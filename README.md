# Poetry Project (Fuzzy Poetry)

This is an ongoing project being done in collaboration with Professor Gianluca Rizzo, Paganucci Associate Professor of Italian Language and Literature at Colby College, to create a natural language processing tool to aid poetry writing. For more information and to try a web version of our tool, visit [fuzzypoetry.com](https://www.fuzzypoetry.com/).

This repository contains our experimental scripts used for tryingg out new versions of our poem generation pipeline. Our [fuzzy-poetry repository](https://github.com/rskarp/fuzzy-poetry) contains the version(s) of our poem generation pipeline that are currently available for demonstration on our website. In the future, we may restructure our project so this repository may be removed and the content might be moved to the fuzzy-poetry repository instead.
