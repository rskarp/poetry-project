You who in scattered rhymes listen to the sound 
Of those sighs with which I fed the heart
During that first youthful mistake of mine
When I was in part a different man than I am now
I hope I can find forgiveness and pithy 
For the diverse style in which I cry and reason,
Between useless hope and useless pain
From those who understand love out of experience.
Now I can see clearly how I have been a joke
To all the people, for a long time, so much so that when I think about it,I often feel ashamed of myself; 
Shame is the result of my ramblings,
Along with regret, and the clear realization
That what the world likes is but a brief dream
