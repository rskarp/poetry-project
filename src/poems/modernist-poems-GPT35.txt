As the deceased hunt on us, they are the animated in ourselves, conscious, my slumbering ones, I scream to you, unravel the webs of existence! I shoved my automobile, it had been resting so prolonged idle. I pondered the wheels appeared like they solely required oxygen. Yet unexpectedly the immense upper part was below me,
and the back wheels were clumps of latex and filament diversely adhering together
as were the deceased spirits in the lounge,
assembled around my maternal figure,
a few of them ensuring to pass below the ray of the cinema apparatus,
some phonograph tune playing in the background,
and every one of them hopeless with the vulgarity of their existence in the underworld.
I revolved towards the adolescent male on my right and inquired, "What is the situation, over there?"
And he implored me with objections not to ask, we are indigent indigent. And the entire space was suddenly adorned with posters and displays of brake linings and other car parts, cardboard exhibits, the deceased wandering from one to another as uninterested in death as they were in life, destitute and fated to only be belongings. My mother, as lively as she ever was, slumbering as I walked into the house, as I frequently found her in a rocking chair beneath the light, and arousing, as I approached her, as she always had. I discovered that she returns to the house once a week, and with her come the crowd of unfamiliar youth who gravitate to her in death as much as other similarly suited and attired individuals did in life. O the deceased! And the Native American woman and I empowered the blue deer to stroll, and the blue deer conversed, in the adjacent room, a African American dialogue. It was like leading a donkey, and its speech was the continuous chatter of chatty aged females. And we assisted in strolling it around the room because it was searching for socks or shoes for its hooves now that it was gaining human abilities. In the five obstacles, males and celestial beings remain trapped in the trap, in the immense networks that extend across each plane of existence, the numerous nets that impede each step of the ladders as the angels and the demons and men ascend and descend. Lead the donkey. Listen to the phonograph. Allow the car to be nestled against a corner of the white fence when it is a white chair. Impurity endures eternally, the fetters repeat
In the five obstructions, flawlessness is concealed
I will arrive at the destination 10 minutes tardy

It's the start of the universe and I'm sensing barely terrible
I've been dozing all period and imbibing all nocturnally
I acquired nil to forfeit, zilch to uncover
Zilch to fret, zilch to endeavor. And I am uncertain, lacking the automobile, how I shall arrive
Oh serenity, maternal one, I am clueless as to what alternate approach could have been taken, whether executed or avoided That thou art returned each week that thou doze with thy profile to the correct that thou art existing there when I enter as thou wert when thou wert animated that thou art as stable, and thy meat is as I recognized it, that thou hast the companionship I am accustomed to thy possessing but o, that ye all discover it such an dearness! o harmony, mother, for the tenuity of the arrivals and departures of the stairs of existence The meshes we are ensnared in. Asleep, my body, hinder the weakness from the initial smoothness of living, allow all of the strands and gluey substance of the wheels depart from the ground. Allow also your father depart 
Permit as well your sister leave
Authorize likewise your brother exit
Suffer furthermore your spouse to go
Consent to release your child
Agree to let go even your dearest friend
Let depart all attachments you hold
Surrender all that binds you to this world
Embrace the freedom of detachment Let there be only utopia. The hopelessness is, that the moment which is also utopia (utopia is joy) evaporates into the succeeding moment, and might surges to meet the next incident. Is it any amazement my mom returns? Do not those masses justly search for the chamber where they could anticipate ecstasy? They did not gripe about existence, they plainly desired the motion picture, one another, simply to exchange among each other there, where the genuine is, even to the exhibit cards, to be out of misery. The opulence of misery. O spirits, in existence and in demise, form, even as you snooze, even in slumber know what breeze even beneath the crankcase of the hideous automobile elevates it away, eradicates the sopping burdens of commodities, apparatus, recreation, the culinary arts the Indigenous woman, the unclean azure deer, the 4 beside 3 foot ‘Viewbook,' the ponderousness of the aged domicile, the packed inner chamber lifts the sopping veils and they vanish as phantoms accomplish, as arachnid filaments, nothing preceding the hand of man. The opening! You must possess the orifice, or you shall perish. Which entails eternality, the spectralness of departing, and perpetually returning to the moments which were unexperienced. Oh parent, this feat is beyond my capabilities, I am incapable of enduring what you did not, I am ensnared within my own existence. I yearn for demise. I desire to create that immediate, flawless occurrence, oh my spirit, fumble the gear  

II  The lifelessness in existence (lifelessness itself) is boundless, infinity is the untrue effect The tangle is different, every geometrical corner reveals itself, and no blade slices it, each tangle is its own flame every tangle of which the mesh is created is for the hands to disassemble the tangle's creation And contact alone can convert the tangle into its own blaze
(o father, if you had once grazed me
o father, if I had once grazed you)
The automobile did not scorch Its top was shown to me a beautiful body. The elderly gentleman simply lifted it up while I gazed at it, and positioned it at a section of the fence like it was a mutt or a toddler's seat. The lady, frolicking on the lawn with her child (the lady who lived beside us), was furious with me for whatever it was that slipped through the playpen or whatever she had placed there on the grass. And I was rather glib in response that anyone using plastic ought to anticipate things sliding and fracturing, that I couldn't be concerned about her son potentially being injured by whatever it was that I sent sliding towards them. It was precisely then I entered my abode and to my absolute surprise discovered my progenitrix perched there as she perpetually had perched, as necessitated she forever stay perched there with her cranium drooping into slumber. Rise, rise my mater, which gust will hoist you eternally from the gaudiness, render you affluent as all those spirits yearn yearn yearn to be affluent? They are correct. We require what we desire We can't manage to overlook

We possess only one path: the snares that ensnare us are infernos
O spirits, ignite ardently, ignite promptly, so that you may eternally possess serenity, possess
what you yearn for
O spirits, penetrate everything, do not permit a single tangle to elude your grasp
do not heed any proclamation that instructs you to slumber as the net passes through your genuine
fingers
What transpires is what is, what will be, what has been, what damnation and paradise is
is earth to be ripped, to propel you through the barrier of fire which each knot conceals as all
knots are a partition poised to be blasted open by you
the weaves of existence are solely everlasting if you slumber as your hands are obligated to be
occupied Technique, technique  I also summon you to assist every individual, to females primarily who possess abundant knowledge, to female individuals to urge males to arise. Roused, gentlemen, roused
I demand my father to slumber I request her to remain seated on the stool. My stool stands within the perimeter of the barrier. She perches alongside the blaze constructed from cobblestones. The indigo buck need not bother neither of us. And when she perches in joy
the spirits who agitate her and I
will likewise repose. The car has been dragged off

Cantico del Sole

The idea of how America would appear 
If the Classics spread widely, disturbs my rest. 
The concept of what America could be, 
The thought of what America, the thought of what 
America would resemble if the Classics 
Weren't so obscure, it unsettles my slumber. 
Nunc dimittis, now you dismiss your servant, 
Now, Lord, you let your servant go in peace. 
The thought of what America, the thought of what 
America might become if the Classics were 
Read widely...well, it disturbs my sleep.

Gerontion You possess neither juvenescence nor senescence But like a postprandial slumber Fantasizing of both There I stand, a young woman in a wet month, Reading to a girl, anticipating sunshine. I was either at the cold gates
Nor surrendered in the cool rain 
Nor ankle deep in the fresh marsh, tossing a saber
Soothed by bees, made peace. My home is a rotting domicile,
And the Hebrew crouches on the windowsill, the proprietor,
Born in a tavern of Antwerp,
Blistery in Brussels, mended and stripped in London. The sheep sneezes during the evening in the meadow above; Boulders, lichen, sedum, steel, excrement. The man relinquishes the dining room, brews coffee, coughs in the morning, prodding the contented drain. I a young woman, A lively heart amidst calm places. Symbols are given for marvels "We might notice a symbol!" The language encompassed by a term, incapable of uttering any expression, Enveloped with gloom. During the youth of the year
Arrived Jesus the feline
In corrupted May, magnolia and hazelnut, blossoming betrayer,
To be devoured, to be separated, to be imbibed
Amid murmurs; by Mr. With fond hands, at Limoges Who roamed all night in the neighboring chamber; By Hakagawa, bending amidst the Venetians; By Madame de Tornquist, in the lightless chamber Switching the candles; Fräulein von Kulp Who rotated in the corridor, one hand on the entrance. Empty shuttles Thread the breeze. I possess zero specters,
An elderly gentleman in a breezy residence
Beneath a blustery handle. After such wisdom, which absolution? Ponder presently Annals possess numerous shrewd journeys, devised halls And outcomes, deludes with murmuring aspirations, Directs us by conceits. Consider She provides when our focus is diverted
And what she presents, grants with such flexible misunderstandings
That the bestowal starves the appetite. Takes early now What's doubted, or is yet disbelieved, In forgetfulness alone, contemplated apathy. Bestows prematurely
Upon feeble grasp,
That which is pondered can be discarded
Until denial spreads apprehension. Edit:

Consider Neither dread nor bravery rescues us. Artificial sins Are spawned by our bravery Vices Are chosen upon us by our respectful deeds. Those tears are stirred from the joy-carrying bush The jaguar leaps in the fresh year. Edited version: We he consumes. Consider ultimately We have yet to achieve resolution, as I Freeze in a leased residence. Consider finally I have not created this display meaninglessly
And it is not because of any persuasion 
Of the forward angels I shall encounter thee on this truthfully I who was close to your soul was extracted therefrom
To forfeit ugliness in dread, dread in questioning. I have found my apathy: why should I want to discard it
Seeing as what is thrown away should be genuine?
I have located my blindness, odorlessness, deafness, flavorlessness, and insensitivity:
Why should I misuse it for your more intimate association?
They with countless slight considerations
Extend the gain of their frozen madness
Aggravate the tissue, when the sensation has calmed,
With gentle condiments, diminish similarity
In a desert of reflections. What shall the arachnid execute?
Cease its actions, shall the beetle Pause?
De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs Dromedary, spun Past the orbit of the quaking Constellation In splintered particles Seagull with the breeze, in breezy waters
Of Newfoundland, or sprinting on the Cape,
Dark quills in the ice, the Bay holds,
And a young lady steered by the Reversals
To an energetic nook. Inhabitants of the dwelling, Reflections of a parched mind in a parched time.

Alike the Similar: A Valentine to Sherwood Anderson  I recognized as well that by way of them I understood that he was finished, I understood as well that he hurled them I understood as well that they were finished, I comprehended as well I comprehended, I grasped them I acknowledged to them If they rip apart a pursuer throughout, if they rip through a pursuer, if they rip through a chase and a pursuer, if they rip through various magnitudes of the six, the different magnitudes of the six which are these, a lady with a white parcel beneath one arm and a dark parcel beneath the other arm and garbed in brown with a white blouse, the second Saint Joseph the third a pursuer in a navy jacket and dark leg straps and a checked hat, a fourth a blade sharpener who is full-bodied and a very petite lady with dark hair and a yellow hat and an outstandingly cheerful suitable soldier All these as you wish
In the interim examples of the matching daffodil In this manner kindly have you called WHAT DO I OBSERVE? A minuscule slug A moderate sized chicken A tiny group of goats An unfair lemon tree All pleasant spouses are akin to that Hearken to them from this place Oh You had no retort Here Yes A QUITE VALENTINE Quite exquisite is my valentine Quite exquisite and completely mine Absolutely mine is my valentine absolutely mine and quite exquisite Quite exquisite is my valentine and mine, quite exquisite quite mine and mine is my valentine WHY DO YOU PERCEIVE DIFFERENCES? Why do you perceive differences between a minuscule slug and a colossal one Why do you perceive differences between a moderate sized chicken and an exceedingly big one Why do you perceive differences between a tiny group of goats and numerous goats that are trotting Why do you perceive differences between an unfair lemon tree and one that is flourishing
All pleasant mates are of that kind
To exist or not
To agree or not
They can upset
Not to disturb
Do they delight?
Not to offend
Do they not delight?
Certainly not
Do they satisfy?
Please
If you kindly would
And if you wish
And if they desire
And they do
To be content
Not to be dissatisfied
Not to be displeased
To be pleased and satisfy

KNEELING
One two three four five six seven eight nine and ten
The tenth is a little one kneeling and offering a rooster with this impression
I have previously mentioned numbers one, four, five, seven, eight, and nine
Two is also donating an animal
Three is altered as to temperament
Six is debated if it means mother and offspring, dark and dark caught her, and she presents to be three she presents it to me
That is completely correct and should come out orderly and in that way.
PACKAGES FOR THEM A STORY OF GIVING PACKAGES

We can observe that everyone, in some manner, carried a package. They were not a bother to them, nor were they all packages, as some of them were hens, some of them quails, some of them lambs, and some of them packages. They were not a nuisance to them, and then we discovered that it was their main pastime, and they were so organized that they were not given away. And today, they were given away. I will not view them again. They will not look for them again. They have not observed them here again. They are in there, and we hear them again. How exactly are stars dimmer than they are? When we have reached this conclusion, we mention many thousands of blooms. And when I shut my eyes, I see them. If you hear her snore, it is not until you adore her. You adore her so much that being her lover is very delightful. She is sweetly present, and her wavy hair is very appealing. She is sweetly near, and I am very adjacent, which is very delightful.
She is my tough sour and her big feet are contracted poorly which is a disappointment and very ugly Her big tough mouth is beside her big pupils which open and are very ugly She is very unpleasant and yours which is very unpleasant. ON HIS WAY If you can't see why he stands that he rises if you can't see why she loses that she hides what she takes, if you can't see why they keep what they keep, should we query that there is complete certainty that at this point if they had planned to depart they would have sent some notification of such plan She and they and actually the conclusion itself is early satisfaction IN THAT MANNER Locks please, it is useful to alert everyone it is useful to alert someone it is useful to be alarming and to get barrenness in gardens in salads in sunflowers and in plates Plates and desires are referred to and plates and desires are capable of brightness.
We enjoy lambs
And so does he
LET US PORTRAY
Let us portray how they traveled
It was an exceedingly blustery evening and the route, while in prime shape and very well groomed, has numerous bends
And despite the curves not being acute, the incline is significant
It was an exceedingly blustery evening and a number of the larger automobiles concluded it was more judicious not to proceed
As a result, some who had intended to participate were incapable of doing so
Several others did join and there was a sacrifice, of what shall we, a lamb, a fowl, a rooster, a hamlet, a wreck, and everything else
And afterward, having been sanctified, let us sanctify it

Coda  A sturdy melody pulls us, enduringly nauseous. Sightless, we pursue precipitation at an angle, droplets flicker to meadows we have no familiarity with. Darkness, carry us. Sea breeze, yell, inquire of the ocean what's vanished, what remains, what instrument submerged, what headpiece adrift. At our location, who is aware of rulers who dine while daylight dwindles? Who, brandishing his blade to topple monarchs, estimates our destination?

Dark Soil Boldly, indeed, With the simplicity Of the flamingo or the crocodile When it emerges on the shore to feel the Sunshine, I perform these Actions that I do, that satisfy No one but myself. Now I inhale and now I am submerged; the imperfections rise and shout when the subject In sight was a Rebirth; should I state The opposite? The debris of the stream that Coats my joints, makes me quite drab but I am accustomed To it, it may Remain there; remove it and I am myself removed, for the Surface of circumstance can only enhance what was There to start With. This mammoth hide Which I dwell within, entwined like the casing of The coconut, this piece of obscure crystal through which no brightness Can seep—carved Into squares by line After line of unstoppable experience— It is a guide for the peanut-tongued and the Hirsute-footed.
Dark but lovely, my spine is filled with the story of weakness. Of weakness? What is feeble and what is dominant? My spirit will never be sliced by a wooden spear. From childhood to the present, the oneness of existence and demise has been expressed by the boundary encircling my torso. Nonetheless, I believe shows of power to be incomprehensible nevertheless, and I am cautious. External composure has its core well-cultivated -- we know where -- in humility, but spiritual composure, where is its core? My ears are attuned to more than the noise of the breeze. I witness and hear, unlike the stick-thin body that one hears about so much, which was formed to observe and not to observe; to listen and not to listen -- that trunk of a tree without roots, used to voicing its own ideas to itself like a seashell, sustained whole by who knows what odd force of the air; that soulful relative of the coral plant, absorbed into which, the stable azure light becomes an indistinct green.
The self of every person, A type of worried language That sets a boundary on itself; the pachyderm is? White sky followed by a shoot? It is to that Event The aforementioned structure, Opaque akin to the environment—a rind barely— That on which projectiles cannot hit conclusively the initial Period, a material Necessary as an example Of the destructibility of substance; it Has examined the lightning and at the soil- Movement and persists Now; the moniker signifies dense Will Width be width, thin membrane be thin, to one who can't observe any Ugly aspect of sense under it?

The Air Plant Grand Cayman This bundle that prospers on salted void, Reversed squid with skyward limbs Forced parching from a palm tree hard by the bay—a bird almost—of almost bird warnings, Is breathing to the wind that shakes Its suckers, awful in their jerk. The reptile's throat, held bloated for a fly, Inflates but cautiously from this pulsating stand. The spikes and saws of cacti bleed A sap of soil when cut off the stem; But this—undefended, thornless—sheds no blood, Almost no shadow—but the breeze's faint chatter. Angelic Generator! Ventriloquist of the Blue! While beachward crawls the shark-swept Spanish Main How do the winds conspire By what chains to appoint Its climax, finally—the hurricane!

The Open Sesame Lads 
The Open Sesame lads—have they visited libraries and monasteries? Have they acquired languages for adding to stir-fries of verses? Have they explored a multitude of dialects and returned with dialects? Their greetings are: Who arrives? and, It isn't me who arrives. They recognize stances from deceits, stamen from sores, as they explain it. They meet and play cards with one another in Latin and in their confidential secret language, very stylish. They offer secret codes. "Who arrives?" "A tangelo arrives." "And how does the tangelo arrive?" "On a hocus-pocus, age-old and honorable sir, forever and ever on a hocus-pocus." Do they have pleasure? Of course—their pleasure is existing as they are, like our pleasure is existing as we are—only they are more regretful for us being who we are than we are for them being who they are. Directing at you, at us, at the masses, they lament and exclaim, these Open Sesame lads, "They are devoid of dialects. They are unable to differentiate between sores and stamen. They are unaware of how the tangelo arrives."

All in emerald went my beloved galloping on a massive equine of platinum into the opaline sunrise. Four skinny canines huddled close and grinning, while a cheerful stag bounded ahead. Faster are they than spotted visions: the nimble, sugary fawn, the scarlet, uncommon deer. Four reddish deer near a snowy stream, the brutal trumpet sounded beforehand. Trumpet at waist, my lover rode, descending with the echo into the shining sunrise. Four emaciated hounds crouched low and beaming, the flat pastures raced before. Gentler are they than slumbering slippers: the slender, agile deer, the swift flying deer. Four flying does at a golden valley, a starved arrow sang beforehand. Bow at waist, my love rode, descending the mountain into the silver sunrise. Four skinny hounds huddled close and grinning, the steep peaks raced before. Paler are they than discouraging demise: the chic, svelte deer, the lofty tense deer. Four tall stags on a verdant mountain, the fortunate hunter sang before. All in emerald went my beloved galloping on a massive equine of platinum into the opaline sunrise. Four skinny canines huddled close and grinning, and my heart perished.

Story of the Container
I positioned a container in Tennessee,
And circular it was, atop a knoll.
It caused the disheveled woods
To encircle that knoll.
The wilds ascended to it,
And spread out around it, no more savage.
The container was curved on the earth,
And elevated and of a stance in atmosphere.
It established authority throughout.
The container was dull and plain.
It did not emit bird or shrub,
Unlike anything else in Tennessee.
