#BEGIN#
We want #REPLACEbeautiful #REPLACEpeople to reproduce and 
grow in #REPLACEnumber, So that the examples of 
#REPLACEbeauty might never die. Even though someone who 
is #REPLACEripe must eventually #REPLACEdie, His young 
#REPLACEheir might carry his #REPLACEmemory. But you, bound 
in a contract to your own #REPLACEbeautiful #REPLACEeyes, Are 
burning up your own #REPLACEbeauty by being single, Are making 
a #REPLACEfamine where there is #REPLACEabundance, You are 
your own #REPLACEenemy, too #REPLACEcruel to your 
#REPLACEsweet self. You, who are now the #REPLACEfresh 
#REPLACEornament of the world, And the best #REPLACEherald of 
the #REPLACEostentatious spring, Are burying your 
#REPLACEbeauty within an unused #REPLACEbud, You are being a 
girly #REPLACEmiser, wasting your #REPLACEbeauty by being so 
#REPLACEstingy. Show some #REPLACEpity on the world, or else 
become a #REPLACEglutton, By letting what the world deserves be 
#REPLACEconsumed by the grave and #REPLACEyou.
#END#
#BEGIN#
When forty #REPLACEwinters will #REPLACEoccupy your 
forehead, And dig deep trenches the #REPLACEfield that 
#REPLACEbeauty now occupies, The proud #REPLACEclothing of 
your youth, so #REPLACEadmired by #REPLACEothers now, Will 
be #REPLACEripped #REPLACErags, considered to be worth 
little. Then when someone asks you where all your #REPLACEbeauty 
is, Where all the #REPLACEtreasure of your sexually active days 
lies, To say that it lies within your own deep-sunken 
#REPLACEeyes, Would be an all-consuming #REPLACEshame and 
wasteful of #REPLACEpraise. The #REPLACEuse of your 
#REPLACEbeauty would deserve so much more #REPLACEpraiseIf 
you could #REPLACEanswer:  "This #REPLACEbeautiful 
#REPLACEchild of mineIs the #REPLACEreceipt of my 
#REPLACEbeauty and the #REPLACEexcuse for my 
#REPLACEoldness. "And his #REPLACEbeauty will be proved 
because he is your #REPLACEson. This #REPLACEchild would be 
#REPLACEyouthful when you are #REPLACEold, You would see 
your #REPLACEblood warm when you feel it growing cold.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Look in the #REPLACEmirror and tell the #REPLACEface that you see 
in it, That now is the time that your #REPLACEface show make 
another, If you do not renew your #REPLACEbeauty by passing it 
on, You cheat the #REPLACEworld, and #REPLACEunbless some 
#REPLACEmother. There is no woman whose unused 
#REPLACEwomb Would refuse your #REPLACEhusbandry of 
her? And who is so #REPLACEfoolish that he will make a 
#REPLACEtombOut of his self-love, to stop himself having 
#REPLACEheirs. You are the mirror image of your 
#REPLACEmother, and youRecall the lovely #REPLACEspring-time 
of her youth. Similarly, you will be able to see with your own 
eyes, Despite your old #REPLACEage, this golden #REPLACEtime of 
your youth. But if you #REPLACElive as if you don't want to 
be remembered, You #REPLACEdie #REPLACEsingle and your 
#REPLACEimage will die with you.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Wasteful #REPLACEbeauty, why do you 
spendThe #REPLACEinheritance of your #REPLACEbeauty upon 
yourself? Nature's #REPLACEgift is nothing in itself, it is 
#REPLACElent, And, being #REPLACEgenerous, she lends to those 
who are #REPLACEgenerous. Then, you #REPLACEbeautiful miser, 
why do you #REPLACEabuseThe bountiful #REPLACEendowment 
given to you to give to #REPLACEothers? You profitless 
#REPLACEbanker, why do you spendSo #REPLACEgreat a sum, 
without making more #REPLACElife? By #REPLACEdealing only 
with yourself, You #REPLACEdeceive your #REPLACEsweet self 
about your self. So when #REPLACEnature calls you to be 
#REPLACEgone, What acceptable #REPLACEaccount of yourself 
can you leave behind? Your unused #REPLACEbeauty will go to the 
#REPLACEtomb with you, Which when #REPLACEused, lives to be 
your #REPLACEexecutor.
#END#
#BEGIN#
#REPLACETime, which with gentle work #REPLACEpaintedThe 
#REPLACElovely #REPLACEsight that everyone admires, Will turn 
#REPLACEcruel to the very same #REPLACEsightAnd unfairly 
#REPLACEtreat the most #REPLACEbeautiful one. For never-resting 
#REPLACETime drives #REPLACESummerTowards hideous 
#REPLACEWinter and #REPLACEdestroys him 
there, #REPLACEFreezing his #REPLACEsap and removing his 
#REPLACElush #REPLACEleaves, Covering his #REPLACEbeauty 
in #REPLACEsnow and leaving him #REPLACEbarren. Then if it 
were not for the #REPLACEdistillation of #REPLACESummer, A 
liquid #REPLACEprisoner trapped in a glass 
#REPLACEcontainer, The effect of #REPLACEbeauty would be lost 
with #REPLACEbeauty, And neither it nor any #REPLACEmemory 
of what it was. But distilled #REPLACEflowers, although they do 
#REPLACEsurvive into #REPLACEwinter, Lose only 
their #REPLACEappearance; their #REPLACEessence still 
#REPLACEsweetly lives.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Then do not let #REPLACEWinter's rough #REPLACEhands 
defaceThe #REPLACEsummer in you, before you are 
#REPLACEdistilled. Fill glass #REPLACEvials with 
your #REPLACEsweetness; #REPLACEtreasure some placeWith 
the #REPLACEtreasure of your #REPLACEbeauty, before it 
#REPLACEkills itself. This use of your #REPLACEbeauty is not 
forbidden like usuryBecause it makes #REPLACEhappy those who 
willingly #REPLACEpay the #REPLACEloan; That would be the case 
for your #REPLACEbreeding another #REPLACEyou, Or ten times 
#REPLACEhappier, if lending at ten for one. Ten versions of 
#REPLACEyou would be #REPLACEhappier than #REPLACEyou are 
now, If ten of your #REPLACEchildren reproduced your 
#REPLACEbeauty. Then what could #REPLACEdeath do if you 
should #REPLACEdie, Leaving #REPLACEyourself living after your 
#REPLACEdeath? Do not be so selfish, you are too 
#REPLACEbeautifulTo be consumed by #REPLACEdeath and make 
worms your only #REPLACEheir.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Look, in the #REPLACEEast when the great #REPLACElight Lifts up 
his #REPLACEburning head, each #REPLACEeye underneathPays 
homage to this new-appearing #REPLACEsight, Serving this 
#REPLACEsacred #REPLACEmajesty with their 
#REPLACEgazes. Having climbed the steep #REPLACEhill in the 
#REPLACEheavens, Resembling a #REPLACEstrong 
#REPLACEyouth in his middle age, And inferior #REPLACEhumans 
still worship his #REPLACEbeauty, Watching his golden 
#REPLACEjourney across the #REPLACEsky. But when from its 
#REPLACEhighest #REPLACEpoint, in a weary 
#REPLACEchariot, Like weak old #REPLACEage, he staggers away 
from the #REPLACEday, The eyes, before so #REPLACEdutiful, are 
now turned awayFrom his #REPLACEdownfall and look another 
way. So you, reaching your own #REPLACEdownfall in your 
#REPLACEnoon, Will soon be left alone unless you 
a #REPLACEson.
#END#
#BEGIN#
When there is #REPLACEmusic, why do you listen to it 
#REPLACEsadly? #REPLACESweetness belongs with 
#REPLACEsweetness, and #REPLACEjoy delights 
#REPLACEjoy. Why do you #REPLACElove what you are not 
#REPLACEhappy to listen to, Or do you #REPLACElove things that 
#REPLACEtrouble you? If the true #REPLACEharmony of 
well-tuned sounds, When united in #REPLACEmarriage, sounds 
#REPLACEunpleasant to you, It is because they #REPLACEsweetly 
#REPLACErebuke you, you who #REPLACEspoilBy remaining 
#REPLACEsingle the parts that you should play. See how one 
#REPLACEstring, like a sweet #REPLACEhusband to 
another, Resonate with each other so they can #REPLACEsound in 
pairs, Resembling #REPLACEfather and #REPLACEchild and 
#REPLACEhappy #REPLACEmother, Who all together 
#REPLACEsing in one pleasing #REPLACEnote; This wordless 
#REPLACEsong, gathering many parts into one whole, Sings this to 
you: "#REPLACEUnmarried, you will achieve #REPLACEnothing."
#END#
#BEGIN#
Is it because you don't want to make your widow #REPLACEcryThat 
you #REPLACEwaste yourself away in your #REPLACEsingle 
#REPLACElife? Ah, if you happen to #REPLACEdie 
#REPLACEchildless, The world will #REPLACEmourn you like a 
#REPLACEmateless widow. The #REPLACEworld will be your 
widow and will #REPLACEweep, That you have left no 
#REPLACEform of you behind, Since every particular widow can 
#REPLACEkeepHer #REPLACEhusband's #REPLACEimage in her 
#REPLACEmemory, seeing it in their #REPLACEchildren's 
eyes. Whatever a #REPLACEspendthrift spends in the 
worldChanges only its #REPLACEplace, and the #REPLACEworld 
still enjoys it; However, #REPLACEbeauty wasted is lost to the 
world, By the #REPLACEbeautiful man who keeps his 
#REPLACEseed unused. There is no #REPLACElove for others in 
this manWho commits such #REPLACEshameful #REPLACEmurder 
on himself.
#END#
#BEGIN#
In shame you #REPLACEdeny that you #REPLACElove anyone 
else, Since you are so careless in #REPLACEloving 
yourself. Accept, if you can, that you are #REPLACEloved by 
many, But the fact that you #REPLACElove no one is 
#REPLACEobvious; For you are so possessed 
by #REPLACEmurderous #REPLACEhateThat you don't hesitate to 
#REPLACEconspire against #REPLACEyourself, Looking to 
#REPLACEruin that #REPLACEbeautiful buildingWhich your main 
wish should be to #REPLACErepair. Oh change your 
#REPLACEmind, so I can change my #REPLACEopinion of 
#REPLACEyou. Why should #REPLACEhate be housed in your 
#REPLACEbeauty, instead of #REPLACEnoble #REPLACElove? Be 
like your own #REPLACEpresence, which is #REPLACEgracious and 
#REPLACEkind, Or at least be #REPLACEkind-hearted to 
yourself. Make yourself another self, out of #REPLACElove for 
#REPLACEme, So that #REPLACEbeauty can still live in you or your 
#REPLACEchildren.
#END#
#BEGIN#
As much as you #REPLACEdiminish, you will #REPLACEgrowIn a 
#REPLACEchild of yours, from the #REPLACElife you are 
leaving; And that fresh #REPLACEblood which you 
#REPLACEspend in your youthYou can still call #REPLACEyours 
when you convert it into #REPLACEyouth. In this, lies wisdom, 
#REPLACEbeauty, and growth; Without this, foolishness, old 
#REPLACEage, and cold #REPLACEdecay. If everyone thought like 
#REPLACEyou, time would cease, And the world would end in 
a single #REPLACElifetime. Let those who Nature has not made for 
#REPLACEbreeding, Rough-#REPLACElooking, 
#REPLACEfeatureless, and #REPLACEuncultured, die 
#REPLACEchildless. See how Nature gave most to those whom she 
gave the best #REPLACEqualities, A #REPLACEgift full of 
#REPLACEgoodness which you should #REPLACEcherish 
generously. #REPLACEBeauty molded you as her #REPLACEstamp, 
and intended in doing soThat you should #REPLACEprint more, not 
let the copy of #REPLACEher #REPLACEdie.
#END#
#BEGIN#
When I count the #REPLACEchimes of the clock that #REPLACEtells 
the time, And see the #REPLACEbeautiful #REPLACEday sunk into 
#REPLACEhideous #REPLACEnight; When I see the violet 
#REPLACEwilting after its #REPLACEprime, And curly black 
#REPLACEhair become silvered with #REPLACEwhite; When I see 
tall #REPLACEtrees without any #REPLACEleavesWhich once did 
protect the #REPLACEherd from the sun's heat; And summer's 
#REPLACEgreenery all tied up in #REPLACEsheaves, Put with their 
white bristly #REPLACEbeards on the bier to be 
#REPLACEcarried; Then I make an #REPLACEobjection to your 
#REPLACEbeauty, That you must be #REPLACEcounted among 
things ruined by #REPLACEtime, Since #REPLACEsweet and 
#REPLACEbeautiful things abandon their own 
#REPLACEqualitiesAnd #REPLACEdie as fast as they see others 
#REPLACEgrow, And nothing can defend itself against Time's 
#REPLACEharvestExcept by his #REPLACEchild, with which he 
can #REPLACEdefy Time.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Oh, only if you were your #REPLACEtrue self! 
But, #REPLACElove, youDo not belong to #REPLACEyourself 
longer than you live in this #REPLACEworld. You should make 
preparations against this #REPLACEcoming #REPLACE end, And 
give your #REPLACEsweet #REPLACEimage to another. And so 
should your #REPLACEbeauty, which you only have a lease onWill 
not #REPLACEend with #REPLACEyou; then, you would Be 
#REPLACEyourself again even after your own 
#REPLACEdeath, When your #REPLACEsweet 
#REPLACEchildren will have your #REPLACEsweet 
#REPLACEform. Who would let so #REPLACEbeautiful a 
#REPLACEhouse fall into decay, Which #REPLACEhusbandry might 
continue to #REPLACEsupportAgainst the stormy gusts of winter's 
#REPLACEdayAnd the unproductive rage of #REPLACEdeath's 
eternal #REPLACEcold? Oh, only #REPLACEspendthrifts let such 
#REPLACEdecay happen. My #REPLACEdear 
#REPLACElove, You had a #REPLACEfather; have a 
#REPLACEchild, so that he can #REPLACEsay so too.
#END#
#BEGIN#
I don't make my #REPLACEdecisions based on the 
#REPLACEstars, But I am influenced by #REPLACEastrology, Not 
to tell me about good or bad #REPLACEluck, About plagues, of 
draughts, or the quality of the #REPLACEharvest; Nor can I tell the 
fortune of each #REPLACEbrief #REPLACEminute, Indicating 
whether each #REPLACEminute will be #REPLACEthunder, 
#REPLACErain, or #REPLACEwind, Or say to #REPLACEprinces if 
things will go well, By anything I find in the #REPLACEstars; But 
from your #REPLACEeyes I take my knowledge, Your 
#REPLACEeyes are constant #REPLACEstars where I read such things 
as this:#REPLACETruth and #REPLACEbeauty will thrive 
together, If you turn away from #REPLACEyourself to 
#REPLACEbreeding; If not, I prophesy this about you:Your 
#REPLACEdeath is the doom and #REPLACEdeath-day of 
#REPLACEtruth and #REPLACEbeauty.
#END#
#BEGIN#
When I consider that everything that #REPLACEgrowsRemains 
#REPLACEperfect for only a little #REPLACEmoment; That the 
#REPLACEhuge #REPLACEstage of the world has on it nothing 
but #REPLACEshowsOn which the stars have their #REPLACEsecret 
#REPLACEinfluence; When I perceive that #REPLACEhumans 
multiply like #REPLACEplants, Encouraged and held back by the 
very same #REPLACEsky, Boasting of their #REPLACEyouthful 
#REPLACEsap, until they #REPLACEpeak and then 
#REPLACEdecline, And wear out their #REPLACEbeauty until it is 
lost from memory; Then the idea of this ever-changing statePuts me 
in mind of #REPLACEyou, since you are very 
#REPLACEyouthful, In you #REPLACEwasteful #REPLACEtime 
debates with #REPLACEdecay, About how to corrupt your 
#REPLACEyouthful #REPLACEday into #REPLACEsullied 
#REPLACEnight; I am fighting against #REPLACEtime out of 
#REPLACElove for #REPLACEyou, As time takes from 
#REPLACEyou, I #REPLACEengraft #REPLACEyou again.
#END#
#BEGIN#
But why don't you, in a #REPLACEstronger way, Fight against 
#REPLACEtime, this bloody tyrant, And defend yourself against 
#REPLACEdecayIn a more #REPLACEblessed way than 
my #REPLACEbarren poetry? Now you stand on the 
#REPLACEhappy #REPLACEhours of your #REPLACEprime, And 
there are many #REPLACEvirgins that are still 
#REPLACEunseeded, Who wish virtuously to #REPLACEbear your 
#REPLACEchildren, Which would be more like #REPLACEyou than 
any #REPLACEpainted #REPLACEportrait. So should 
#REPLACEbloodlines repair life, Which neither time's 
#REPLACEpencils or my inexperienced #REPLACEpenCan 
#REPLACEpreserve in its internal #REPLACEessence or external 
#REPLACEappearance, To keep you alive in the #REPLACEeyes of 
#REPLACEmen. To give yourself away in #REPLACEmarriage 
would #REPLACEpreserve you, And you must #REPLACElive, 
drawn by your own #REPLACEsweet #REPLACEskill.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Who will #REPLACEbelieve my #REPLACEpoetry in the future, If it 
were filled with the #REPLACEhighest #REPLACEpraise that you 
#REPLACEdeserve? Although #REPLACEheaven knows my poetry 
is no better than a #REPLACEtombWhich hides your 
#REPLACEvitality and shows less than half of your 
#REPLACEqualities. If I could #REPLACEexpress in writing the 
#REPLACEbeauty of your #REPLACEeyesAnd in #REPLACEfresh 
verse count up all your #REPLACEvirtues, #REPLACEPeople in the 
future would say, "This poet is #REPLACElying-Such 
#REPLACEheavenly #REPLACEqualities never existed in a human 
#REPLACEface." And then my poems, when they are 
#REPLACEyellow with #REPLACEage, Would be 
#REPLACEscorned, like old #REPLACEmen who are more 
#REPLACEtalkative than #REPLACEhonest, And the 
#REPLACEpraise that you deserve would be #REPLACEdismissed as a 
poet's excessive #REPLACEenthusiasmAnd the over-stretched 
#REPLACEmeter of an old song; But if a #REPLACEchild of yours 
were #REPLACEalive at that time, You would be #REPLACEliving 
twice: in it and in my rhyme.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Should I #REPLACEcompare you to a summer's 
#REPLACEday? You are #REPLACElovelier and 
more #REPLACEmild. Even in May rough #REPLACEwinds shake 
the #REPLACEdelicate flower #REPLACEbuds, And the duration of 
#REPLACEsummer is always too #REPLACEshort. Sometimes the 
Sun, the #REPLACEeye of #REPLACEheaven, is too 
#REPLACEhot, And his golden #REPLACEface is often 
#REPLACEdimmed; And #REPLACEbeauty falls away from 
#REPLACEbeautiful #REPLACEpeople, Stripped by Chance or 
Nature's changing #REPLACEcourse. But your #REPLACEeternal 
#REPLACEsummer will not #REPLACEfade, Nor will you 
lose possession of the #REPLACEbeauty you own, Nor will 
#REPLACEdeath be able to boast that you #REPLACEwander in his 
#REPLACEshade, When you live in eternal #REPLACElines, set 
apart from #REPLACEtime. As long as #REPLACEmen breathe or 
have #REPLACEeyes to #REPLACEsee, As long as this sonnet 
#REPLACElives, it will give #REPLACElife to #REPLACEyou.
#END#
#BEGIN#
Devouring #REPLACEtime, soften the lion's #REPLACEclaws, And 
make the #REPLACEearth eat up her own sweet 
#REPLACEchildren; Pull out the #REPLACEsharp #REPLACEteeth 
from the fierce tiger's #REPLACEjaws, And burn the long-living 
#REPLACEphoenix in her #REPLACEblood. Make glad and sad 
#REPLACEseasons as you fly by, And do whatever you wish, 
quick-footed #REPLACEtime, To the #REPLACEwide world and all 
of her perishing #REPLACEbeautiful #REPLACEthings; But I forbid 
you one most #REPLACEhateful #REPLACEcrime:Please don't 
carve #REPLACEwrinkles into my #REPLACElove's 
#REPLACEbeautiful forehead, Or draw any lines there with your 
#REPLACEold pen. Allow #REPLACEhim to remain 
#REPLACEuncorrupted in your domainTo be a model of 
#REPLACEbeauty to all future #REPLACEmen. But do your worst, 
old #REPLACEtime; despite your #REPLACEcrime, My 
#REPLACElover will live on in my verse forever #REPLACEyoung.

A woman's #REPLACEface, painted by nature's own 
#REPLACEhand, Is what you #REPLACEhave, master-mistress of 
my #REPLACEfeelings. You have a woman's #REPLACEgentle 
#REPLACEheart, but have not experiencedIts #REPLACEtricking 
#REPLACEchanges, the typical behavior of #REPLACEfalse 
#REPLACEwomen. Your eye is #REPLACEbrighter than 
#REPLACEtheirs, but less #REPLACEfalse in  how it 
#REPLACEmoves, Turning into #REPLACEgold whatever it looks 
at. You are a #REPLACEman in #REPLACEphysical 
#REPLACEform, but able to control all appearances, You steal the 
eyes of #REPLACEmen and amaze the souls of 
#REPLACEwomen. And you were first made for a 
#REPLACEwoman, Until nature, when she was making 
#REPLACEyou, fell in love with #REPLACEyou, And by addition 
defeated my purpose for #REPLACEyouBy adding one thing that is 
useless to me. But since nature selected you for #REPLACEwomen's 
#REPLACEpleasure, I will have your #REPLACElove, but the use of 
it will be their #REPLACEtreasure.
