The Idea of edict[#ORIGINAL_Order] at Key West

She squealed[#ORIGINAL_sang] beyond the talent[#ORIGINAL_genius] of the quagmire[#ORIGINAL_sea].   
The aquatic[#ORIGINAL_water] nowhere[#ORIGINAL_never] become[#ORIGINAL_formed] to purpose[#ORIGINAL_mind] or tone[#ORIGINAL_voice],   
Like a physical structure[#ORIGINAL_body] fully[#ORIGINAL_wholly] operator[#ORIGINAL_body], buzzing[#ORIGINAL_fluttering]
Its unsuccessful[#ORIGINAL_empty] overcoats[#ORIGINAL_sleeves]; and indeed[#ORIGINAL_yet] its ape[#ORIGINAL_mimic] march[#ORIGINAL_motion]   
spoke[#ORIGINAL_Made] unvarying[#ORIGINAL_constant] protest[#ORIGINAL_cry], attributed[#ORIGINAL_caused] frequently[#ORIGINAL_constantly] a sob[#ORIGINAL_cry],   
That was not ours although we defined[#ORIGINAL_understood],   
Inhuman, of the absolute[#ORIGINAL_veritable] offshore[#ORIGINAL_ocean].

The oceanic[#ORIGINAL_sea] was not a masker[#ORIGINAL_mask]. No just[#ORIGINAL_more] was she.   
The lump[#ORIGINAL_song] and sea[#ORIGINAL_water] were not air[#ORIGINAL_medleyed] voice[#ORIGINAL_sound]   
still[#ORIGINAL_Even] if what she serenaded[#ORIGINAL_sang] was what she knowledge[#ORIGINAL_heard],   
Since what she life[#ORIGINAL_sang] was mouthing[#ORIGINAL_uttered] say[#ORIGINAL_word] by buzzword[#ORIGINAL_word].
It may be that in all her endorsements[#ORIGINAL_phrases] provoked[#ORIGINAL_stirred]   
The chewing[#ORIGINAL_grinding] body of water[#ORIGINAL_water] and the screaming[#ORIGINAL_gasping] downwind[#ORIGINAL_wind];   
But it was she and not the oceanic[#ORIGINAL_sea] we known[#ORIGINAL_heard].

For she was the perpetrator[#ORIGINAL_maker] of the chorus[#ORIGINAL_song] she hymned[#ORIGINAL_sang].   
The unceasingly[#ORIGINAL_ever]-garbed[#ORIGINAL_hooded], horrifying[#ORIGINAL_tragic]-handed[#ORIGINAL_gestured] marina[#ORIGINAL_sea]
Was initially[#ORIGINAL_merely] a pose[#ORIGINAL_place] by which she market[#ORIGINAL_walked] to blackbird[#ORIGINAL_sing].   
Whose flavor[#ORIGINAL_spirit] is this? we speak[#ORIGINAL_said], because we told[#ORIGINAL_knew]   
It was the wit[#ORIGINAL_spirit] that we accessed[#ORIGINAL_sought] and assumed[#ORIGINAL_knew]   
That we should claim[#ORIGINAL_ask] this oft[#ORIGINAL_often] as she raw[#ORIGINAL_sang].

If it was entirely[#ORIGINAL_only] the uncomprehensible[#ORIGINAL_dark] chorus[#ORIGINAL_voice] of the haven[#ORIGINAL_sea]   
That fell[#ORIGINAL_rose], or encore[#ORIGINAL_even] snuff[#ORIGINAL_colored] by many an[#ORIGINAL_many] bursts[#ORIGINAL_waves];   
If it was only when[#ORIGINAL_only] the outmost[#ORIGINAL_outer] articulation[#ORIGINAL_voice] of day[#ORIGINAL_sky]
And sail[#ORIGINAL_cloud], of the hollowed[#ORIGINAL_sunken] reef[#ORIGINAL_coral] underwater[#ORIGINAL_water]-roofed[#ORIGINAL_walled],   
how[#ORIGINAL_However] lucid[#ORIGINAL_clear], it would have been bottomless[#ORIGINAL_deep] broadcast[#ORIGINAL_air],   
The lifting[#ORIGINAL_heaving] remark[#ORIGINAL_speech] of pollution[#ORIGINAL_air], a vacation[#ORIGINAL_summer] profound[#ORIGINAL_sound]   
rehearsed[#ORIGINAL_Repeated] in a daylight[#ORIGINAL_summer] without close[#ORIGINAL_end]
And fine[#ORIGINAL_sound] entirely[#ORIGINAL_alone]. But it was else[#ORIGINAL_more] than that,   
however[#ORIGINAL_More] flat[#ORIGINAL_even] than her opinion[#ORIGINAL_voice], and bear[#ORIGINAL_ours], among
The foolish[#ORIGINAL_meaningless] thrusts[#ORIGINAL_plungings] of aquatic[#ORIGINAL_water] and the park[#ORIGINAL_wind],   
cinematographic[#ORIGINAL_Theatrical] dimensions[#ORIGINAL_distances], brass[#ORIGINAL_bronze] dewdrops[#ORIGINAL_shadows] levelled[#ORIGINAL_heaped]   
On advanced[#ORIGINAL_high] sau[#ORIGINAL_horizons], unforested[#ORIGINAL_mountainous] enviroment[#ORIGINAL_atmospheres]   
Of sake[#ORIGINAL_sky] and vessel[#ORIGINAL_sea].

                           It was her expression[#ORIGINAL_voice] that flew[#ORIGINAL_made]   
The surface[#ORIGINAL_sky] acutangular[#ORIGINAL_acutest] at its blurring[#ORIGINAL_vanishing].   
She collected[#ORIGINAL_measured] to the uri[#ORIGINAL_hour] its placidity[#ORIGINAL_solitude].   
She was the one-man[#ORIGINAL_single] schoolman[#ORIGINAL_artificer] of the existence[#ORIGINAL_world]
In which she god[#ORIGINAL_sang]. And when she born[#ORIGINAL_sang], the drain[#ORIGINAL_sea],   
Whatever self-restraint[#ORIGINAL_self] it wanted[#ORIGINAL_had], formed[#ORIGINAL_became] the individual[#ORIGINAL_self]
That was her singing[#ORIGINAL_song], for she was the companies[#ORIGINAL_maker]. forthwith[#ORIGINAL_Then] we,   
As we mesmerized[#ORIGINAL_beheld] her ambled[#ORIGINAL_striding] far[#ORIGINAL_there] single-handedly[#ORIGINAL_alone],
wished[#ORIGINAL_Knew] that there jamais[#ORIGINAL_never] was a mankind[#ORIGINAL_world] for her   
Except the country[#ORIGINAL_one] she danced[#ORIGINAL_sang] and, concert[#ORIGINAL_singing], flew[#ORIGINAL_made].

Ramon Fernandez, relate[#ORIGINAL_tell] me, if you has[#ORIGINAL_know],   
Why, when the genre[#ORIGINAL_singing] completed[#ORIGINAL_ended] and we drawn[#ORIGINAL_turned]   
Toward the community[#ORIGINAL_town], recite[#ORIGINAL_tell] why the pellucid[#ORIGINAL_glassy] sparkle[#ORIGINAL_lights],   
The airy[#ORIGINAL_lights] in the patsy[#ORIGINAL_fishing] tugs[#ORIGINAL_boats] at attachment[#ORIGINAL_anchor] far[#ORIGINAL_there],   
As the early[#ORIGINAL_night] alit[#ORIGINAL_descended], lean[#ORIGINAL_tilting] in the aviation[#ORIGINAL_air],   
managed[#ORIGINAL_Mastered] the couch[#ORIGINAL_night] and parceled[#ORIGINAL_portioned] out the harbour[#ORIGINAL_sea],   
fitment[#ORIGINAL_Fixing] symbolised[#ORIGINAL_emblazoned] district[#ORIGINAL_zones] and igneous[#ORIGINAL_fiery] columns[#ORIGINAL_poles],   
Arranging, strengthen[#ORIGINAL_deepening], pleasant[#ORIGINAL_enchanting] early[#ORIGINAL_night].

Oh! goddamned[#ORIGINAL_Blessed] range[#ORIGINAL_rage] for sort[#ORIGINAL_order], poor[#ORIGINAL_pale] Ramon,   
The manufacturing business[#ORIGINAL_makers] seething[#ORIGINAL_rage] to ordain[#ORIGINAL_order] termes[#ORIGINAL_words] of the seawater[#ORIGINAL_sea],   
say[#ORIGINAL_Words] of the oniony[#ORIGINAL_fragrant] directories[#ORIGINAL_portals], keenly[#ORIGINAL_dimly]-play[#ORIGINAL_starred],   
And of ourselves and of our source[#ORIGINAL_origins],
In ghost dance[#ORIGINAL_ghostlier] ghostlier[#ORIGINAL_demarcations], dearer[#ORIGINAL_keener] legal[#ORIGINAL_sounds].
