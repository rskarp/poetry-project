#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangler[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] air[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread curiously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging together
 
as were the dead souls[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projection[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the bawdiness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right and asked, “How is it,
here[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the hole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessoriness[#ORIGINAL_accessories], corkboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor[#ORIGINAL_poor] and doomed
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the bouse[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I sound[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like suited and dressed people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    -enabled[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like waling[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread out across each plano[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angeln[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a conner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instant[#ORIGINAL_instant] of being, the trammels
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the plane[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the might[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were live[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the comings and goings
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The nets we are tangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, let the poder[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let even your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradis[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and poder[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously waited[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each outher[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
know what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of agoing[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instance[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, slip[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] cause
 
The knot is other wise[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net is made[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s making. And touch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not represented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corps[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the glass[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out[#ORIGINAL_out] there on the glass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my bouse[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 fond[#ORIGINAL_found] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting there
 
                                 as she always[#ORIGINAL_always] had sat, as must she always
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] here[#ORIGINAL_there] her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, aware[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are light[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have[#ORIGINAL_have] only one corse[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         live[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn now
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have
 
                                         what you crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your inauthentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the skreen[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall ready[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to aware[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         aware[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in unhappiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
