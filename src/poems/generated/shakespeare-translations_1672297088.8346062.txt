#BEGIN# 
We want splendiferous[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] grassroots[#ORIGINAL_people] to reproduce and  
grow in keep down[#ORIGINAL_number], So that the examples of  
pretty[#ORIGINAL_beauty] might never die. Even though someone who  
is overripe[#ORIGINAL_ripe] must eventually break[#ORIGINAL_die], His young  
legatee[#ORIGINAL_heir] might carry his mind[#ORIGINAL_memory]. But you, bound  
in a contract to your own comely[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] center[#ORIGINAL_eyes], Are  
burning up your own beau[#ORIGINAL_beauty] by being single, Are making  
a genocide[#ORIGINAL_famine] where there is vast[#ORIGINAL_abundance], You are  
your own nemesis[#ORIGINAL_enemy], too inhuman[#ORIGINAL_cruel] to your  
saccharine[#ORIGINAL_sweet] self. You, who are now the firm[#ORIGINAL_fresh]  
adorn[#ORIGINAL_ornament] of the world, And the best harbinger[#ORIGINAL_herald] of  
the striking[#ORIGINAL_ostentatious] spring, Are burying your  
mantrap[#ORIGINAL_beauty] within an unused ovum[#ORIGINAL_bud], You are being a  
girly scrooge[#ORIGINAL_miser], wasting your good-looking[#ORIGINAL_beauty] by being so  
grudging[#ORIGINAL_stingy]. Show some regretting[#ORIGINAL_pity] on the world, or else  
become a sweet tooth[#ORIGINAL_glutton], By letting what the world deserves be  
drinking[#ORIGINAL_consumed] by the grave and you[#ORIGINAL_you]. 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
When forty cold[#ORIGINAL_winters] will employ[#ORIGINAL_occupy] your  
forehead, And dig deep trenches the playing field[#ORIGINAL_field] that  
grace[#ORIGINAL_beauty] now occupies, The proud vesture[#ORIGINAL_clothing] of  
your youth, so loved[#ORIGINAL_admired] by early[#ORIGINAL_others] now, Will  
be damaged[#ORIGINAL_ripped] dress down[#ORIGINAL_rags], considered to be worth  
little. Then when someone asks you where all your pretty[#ORIGINAL_beauty]  
is, Where all the richness[#ORIGINAL_treasure] of your sexually active days  
lies, To say that it lies within your own deep-sunken  
eyelets[#ORIGINAL_eyes], Would be an all-consuming embarrassment[#ORIGINAL_shame] and  
wasteful of congratulations[#ORIGINAL_praise]. The consumption[#ORIGINAL_use] of your  
good-looking[#ORIGINAL_beauty] would deserve so much more praiseIf[#ORIGINAL_praiseIf]  
you could responder[#ORIGINAL_answer]:  "This pretty[#ORIGINAL_beautiful]  
small fry[#ORIGINAL_child] of mineIs the reception[#ORIGINAL_receipt] of my  
mantrap[#ORIGINAL_beauty] and the alibi[#ORIGINAL_excuse] for my  
antiquity[#ORIGINAL_oldness]. "And his good-looking[#ORIGINAL_beauty] will be proved  
because he is your sonny[#ORIGINAL_son]. This boy[#ORIGINAL_child] would be  
cadet[#ORIGINAL_youthful] when you are senior[#ORIGINAL_old], You would see  
your serum[#ORIGINAL_blood] warm when you feel it growing cold. 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
Look in the overlap[#ORIGINAL_mirror] and tell the human face[#ORIGINAL_face] that you see  
in it, That now is the time that your facial expression[#ORIGINAL_face] show make  
another, If you do not renew your attractiveness[#ORIGINAL_beauty] by passing it  
on, You cheat the humankind[#ORIGINAL_world], and sacrificant[#ORIGINAL_unbless] some  
mum[#ORIGINAL_mother]. There is no woman whose unused  
belly[#ORIGINAL_womb] Would refuse your farm[#ORIGINAL_husbandry] of  
her? And who is so derisory[#ORIGINAL_foolish] that he will make a  
tombOut[#ORIGINAL_tombOut] of his self-love, to stop himself having  
successor[#ORIGINAL_heirs]. You are the mirror image of your  
father[#ORIGINAL_mother], and youRecall the lovely outpouring[#ORIGINAL_spring]-time  
of her youth. Similarly, you will be able to see with your own  
eyes, Despite your old senior[#ORIGINAL_age], this golden timekeeping[#ORIGINAL_time] of  
your youth. But if you lively[#ORIGINAL_live] as if you don't want to  
be remembered, You fail[#ORIGINAL_die] unvarying[#ORIGINAL_single] and your  
mental image[#ORIGINAL_image] will die with you. 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
Wasteful mantrap[#ORIGINAL_beauty], why do you  
spendThe bequest[#ORIGINAL_inheritance] of your beau[#ORIGINAL_beauty] upon  
yourself? Nature's offering[#ORIGINAL_gift] is nothing in itself, it is  
devoted[#ORIGINAL_lent], And, being unsparing[#ORIGINAL_generous], she lends to those  
who are openhanded[#ORIGINAL_generous]. Then, you pleasant[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] miser,  
why do you abuseThe[#ORIGINAL_abuseThe] bountiful donor[#ORIGINAL_endowment]  
given to you to give to another[#ORIGINAL_others]? You profitless  
mortgage[#ORIGINAL_banker], why do you spendSo large[#ORIGINAL_great] a sum,  
without making more animation[#ORIGINAL_life]? By working[#ORIGINAL_dealing] only  
with yourself, You disorientate[#ORIGINAL_deceive] your saccharine[#ORIGINAL_sweet] self  
about your self. So when natural phenomenon[#ORIGINAL_nature] calls you to be  
away[#ORIGINAL_gone], What acceptable bank[#ORIGINAL_account] of yourself  
can you leave behind? Your unused knockout[#ORIGINAL_beauty] will go to the  
gravestone[#ORIGINAL_tomb] with you, Which when misused[#ORIGINAL_used], lives to be  
your decedent[#ORIGINAL_executor].

Time[#ORIGINAL_Time], which with gentle work paintedThe[#ORIGINAL_paintedThe]  
adorable[#ORIGINAL_lovely] pile[#ORIGINAL_sight] that everyone admires, Will turn  
rude[#ORIGINAL_cruel] to the very same sightAnd[#ORIGINAL_sightAnd] unfairly  
reward[#ORIGINAL_treat] the most well-favoured[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] one. For never-resting  
momentum[#ORIGINAL_Time] drives SummerTowards[#ORIGINAL_SummerTowards] hideous  
cold[#ORIGINAL_Winter] and kills[#ORIGINAL_destroys] him  
there, chilling[#ORIGINAL_Freezing] his phloem[#ORIGINAL_sap] and removing his  
lucullan[#ORIGINAL_lush] quit[#ORIGINAL_leaves], Covering his stunner[#ORIGINAL_beauty]  
in ice[#ORIGINAL_snow] and leaving him stark[#ORIGINAL_barren]. Then if it  
were not for the drag[#ORIGINAL_distillation] of Summer[#ORIGINAL_Summer], A  
liquid ex-con[#ORIGINAL_prisoner] trapped in a glass  
crate[#ORIGINAL_container], The effect of sweetheart[#ORIGINAL_beauty] would be lost  
with beautiful[#ORIGINAL_beauty], And neither it nor any memory board[#ORIGINAL_memory]  
of what it was. But distilled bloom[#ORIGINAL_flowers], although they do  
make it[#ORIGINAL_survive] into snow[#ORIGINAL_winter], Lose only  
their coming into court[#ORIGINAL_appearance]; their concrete[#ORIGINAL_essence] still  
sweetly[#ORIGINAL_sweetly] lives. 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
Then do not let Winter[#ORIGINAL_Winter]'s rough on[#ORIGINAL_hands]  
defaceThe beena[#ORIGINAL_summer] in you, before you are  
distil[#ORIGINAL_distilled]. Fill glass ampoule[#ORIGINAL_vials] with  
your honey[#ORIGINAL_sweetness]; stash[#ORIGINAL_treasure] some placeWith  
the stash[#ORIGINAL_treasure] of your dish[#ORIGINAL_beauty], before it  
toss off[#ORIGINAL_kills] itself. This use of your good-looking[#ORIGINAL_beauty] is not  
forbidden like usuryBecause it makes blessed[#ORIGINAL_happy] those who  
willingly buy[#ORIGINAL_pay] the money[#ORIGINAL_loan]; That would be the case  
for your reproducing[#ORIGINAL_breeding] another you[#ORIGINAL_you], Or ten times  
grumpier[#ORIGINAL_happier], if lending at ten for one. Ten versions of  
you[#ORIGINAL_you] would be better[#ORIGINAL_happier] than you[#ORIGINAL_you] are  
now, If ten of your births[#ORIGINAL_children] reproduced your  
mantrap[#ORIGINAL_beauty]. Then what could extinction[#ORIGINAL_death] do if you  
should go[#ORIGINAL_die], Leaving yourself[#ORIGINAL_yourself] living after your  
decease[#ORIGINAL_death]? Do not be so selfish, you are too  
beautifulTo[#ORIGINAL_beautifulTo] be consumed by end[#ORIGINAL_death] and make  
worms your only heritage[#ORIGINAL_heir].

Look, in the East[#ORIGINAL_East] when the great fluorescent[#ORIGINAL_light] Lifts up  
his blazing[#ORIGINAL_burning] head, each middle[#ORIGINAL_eye] underneathPays  
homage to this new-appearing slew[#ORIGINAL_sight], Serving this  
unspeakable[#ORIGINAL_sacred] sire[#ORIGINAL_majesty] with their  
starets[#ORIGINAL_gazes]. Having climbed the steep mont[#ORIGINAL_hill] in the  
christ[#ORIGINAL_heavens], Resembling a substantial[#ORIGINAL_strong]  
youngster[#ORIGINAL_youth] in his middle age, And inferior masters[#ORIGINAL_humans]  
still worship his good-looking[#ORIGINAL_beauty], Watching his golden  
travel[#ORIGINAL_journey] across the hemisphere[#ORIGINAL_sky]. But when from its  
maximum[#ORIGINAL_highest] show[#ORIGINAL_point], in a weary  
char[#ORIGINAL_chariot], Like weak old ageism[#ORIGINAL_age], he staggers away  
from the era[#ORIGINAL_day], The eyes, before so fastidious[#ORIGINAL_dutiful], are  
now turned awayFrom his ruin[#ORIGINAL_downfall] and look another  
way. So you, reaching your own decline[#ORIGINAL_downfall] in your  
hour[#ORIGINAL_noon], Will soon be left alone unless you  
a mother[#ORIGINAL_son]. 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
When there is medicine[#ORIGINAL_music], why do you listen to it  
unhappily[#ORIGINAL_sadly]? Sweetness[#ORIGINAL_Sweetness] belongs with  
kiddo[#ORIGINAL_sweetness], and glad[#ORIGINAL_joy] delights  
delight[#ORIGINAL_joy]. Why do you romance[#ORIGINAL_love] what you are not  
fortunate[#ORIGINAL_happy] to listen to, Or do you amour[#ORIGINAL_love] things that  
cark[#ORIGINAL_trouble] you? If the true unanimity[#ORIGINAL_harmony] of  
well-tuned sounds, When united in marriage ceremony[#ORIGINAL_marriage], sounds  
objectionable[#ORIGINAL_unpleasant] to you, It is because they wonderfully[#ORIGINAL_sweetly]  
reprimand[#ORIGINAL_rebuke] you, you who spoilBy[#ORIGINAL_spoilBy] remaining  
exclusive[#ORIGINAL_single] the parts that you should play. See how one  
twine[#ORIGINAL_string], like a sweet married man[#ORIGINAL_husband] to  
another, Resonate with each other so they can complete[#ORIGINAL_sound] in  
pairs, Resembling founder[#ORIGINAL_father] and fry[#ORIGINAL_child] and  
prosperous[#ORIGINAL_happy] mum[#ORIGINAL_mother], Who all together  
talk[#ORIGINAL_sing] in one pleasing bill[#ORIGINAL_note]; This wordless  
melody[#ORIGINAL_song], gathering many parts into one whole, Sings this to  
you: "Unmarried[#ORIGINAL_Unmarried], you will achieve nothing[#ORIGINAL_nothing]." 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
Is it because you don't want to make your widow cryThat[#ORIGINAL_cryThat]  
you squander[#ORIGINAL_waste] yourself away in your one-person[#ORIGINAL_single]  
soul[#ORIGINAL_life]? Ah, if you happen to fail[#ORIGINAL_die]  
childless[#ORIGINAL_childless], The world will weep[#ORIGINAL_mourn] you like a  
unmarried[#ORIGINAL_mateless] widow. The humankind[#ORIGINAL_world] will be your  
widow and will cry[#ORIGINAL_weep], That you have left no  
variant[#ORIGINAL_form] of you behind, Since every particular widow can  
keepHer[#ORIGINAL_keepHer] father[#ORIGINAL_husband]'s project[#ORIGINAL_image] in her  
store[#ORIGINAL_memory], seeing it in their burdens[#ORIGINAL_children]'s  
eyes. Whatever a prodigal[#ORIGINAL_spendthrift] spends in the  
worldChanges only its spot[#ORIGINAL_place], and the mankind[#ORIGINAL_world]  
still enjoys it; However, dish[#ORIGINAL_beauty] wasted is lost to the  
world, By the picturesque[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] man who keeps his  
seedbed[#ORIGINAL_seed] unused. There is no beloved[#ORIGINAL_love] for others in  
this manWho commits such ashamed[#ORIGINAL_shameful] slay[#ORIGINAL_murder]  
on himself. 
#END# 
#BEGIN# 
In shame you disavow[#ORIGINAL_deny] that you lovemaking[#ORIGINAL_love] anyone  
else, Since you are so careless in tenderhearted[#ORIGINAL_loving]  
yourself. Accept, if you can, that you are blue-eyed[#ORIGINAL_loved] by  
many, But the fact that you lovemaking[#ORIGINAL_love] no one is  
overt[#ORIGINAL_obvious]; For you are so possessed  
by homicidal[#ORIGINAL_murderous] hateThat[#ORIGINAL_hateThat] you don't hesitate to  
concoct[#ORIGINAL_conspire] against yourself[#ORIGINAL_yourself], Looking to  
break[#ORIGINAL_ruin] that splendiferous[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] buildingWhich your main  
wish should be to restorative[#ORIGINAL_repair]. Oh change your  
beware[#ORIGINAL_mind], so I can change my vox populi[#ORIGINAL_opinion] of  
you[#ORIGINAL_you]. Why should hostility[#ORIGINAL_hate] be housed in your  
looker[#ORIGINAL_beauty], instead of monarchical[#ORIGINAL_noble] passion[#ORIGINAL_love]? Be  
like your own existence[#ORIGINAL_presence], which is propitious[#ORIGINAL_gracious] and  
charitable[#ORIGINAL_kind], Or at least be kindly[#ORIGINAL_kind]-hearted to  
yourself. Make yourself another self, out of romance[#ORIGINAL_love] for  
me[#ORIGINAL_me], So that dish[#ORIGINAL_beauty] can still live in you or your  
births[#ORIGINAL_children].

As much as you abate[#ORIGINAL_diminish], you will growIn[#ORIGINAL_growIn] a

leaving; And that fresh gore[#ORIGINAL_blood] which you  
use up[#ORIGINAL_spend] in your youthYou can still call yours[#ORIGINAL_yours]  
when you convert it into teen[#ORIGINAL_youth]. In this, lies wisdom,  
sweetheart[#ORIGINAL_beauty], and growth; Without this, foolishness, old  
years[#ORIGINAL_age], and cold decline[#ORIGINAL_decay]. If everyone thought like  
you[#ORIGINAL_you], time would cease, And the world would end in  
a single effectivity[#ORIGINAL_lifetime]. Let those who Nature has not made for  
procreation[#ORIGINAL_breeding], Rough-#REPLACE looking,  
colorless[#ORIGINAL_featureless], and snobbish[#ORIGINAL_uncultured], die  
childless[#ORIGINAL_childless]. See how Nature gave most to those whom she  
gave the best elements[#ORIGINAL_qualities], A donation[#ORIGINAL_gift] full of  
sake[#ORIGINAL_goodness] which you should nourish[#ORIGINAL_cherish]  
generously. sweetheart[#ORIGINAL_Beauty] molded you as her stomp[#ORIGINAL_stamp],  
and intended in doing soThat you should hardcopy[#ORIGINAL_print] more, not  
let the copy of her[#ORIGINAL_her] fail[#ORIGINAL_die].

When I count the bells[#ORIGINAL_chimes] of the clock that secernate[#ORIGINAL_tells]  
the time, And see the fine-looking[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] daytime[#ORIGINAL_day] sunk into  
godforsaken[#ORIGINAL_hideous] midnight[#ORIGINAL_night]; When I see the violet  
evaporating[#ORIGINAL_wilting] after its bloom[#ORIGINAL_prime], And curly black  
hairbreadth[#ORIGINAL_hair] become silvered with flannel[#ORIGINAL_white]; When I see  
tall firs[#ORIGINAL_trees] without any leavesWhich[#ORIGINAL_leavesWhich] once did  
protect the farmer[#ORIGINAL_herd] from the sun's heat; And summer's  
foliage[#ORIGINAL_greenery] all tied up in threshing[#ORIGINAL_sheaves], Put with their  
white bristly goatees[#ORIGINAL_beards] on the bier to be  
blamed[#ORIGINAL_carried]; Then I make an refusal[#ORIGINAL_objection] to your  
dish[#ORIGINAL_beauty], That you must be account[#ORIGINAL_counted] among  
things ruined by sentence[#ORIGINAL_time], Since odorous[#ORIGINAL_sweet] and  
picturesque[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] things abandon their own  
qualitiesAnd[#ORIGINAL_qualitiesAnd] go[#ORIGINAL_die] as fast as they see others  
increase[#ORIGINAL_grow], And nothing can defend itself against Time's  
harvestExcept[#ORIGINAL_harvestExcept] by his baby[#ORIGINAL_child], with which he  
can ignore[#ORIGINAL_defy] Time.

Oh, only if you were your rightful[#ORIGINAL_true] self!  
But, darling[#ORIGINAL_love], youDo not belong to yourself[#ORIGINAL_yourself]  
longer than you live in this worldwide[#ORIGINAL_world]. You should make  
preparations against this comin[#ORIGINAL_coming]  [#ORIGINAL_ ]end, And  
give your odorous[#ORIGINAL_sweet] persona[#ORIGINAL_image] to another. And so  
should your grace[#ORIGINAL_beauty], which you only have a lease onWill  
not closing[#ORIGINAL_end] with you[#ORIGINAL_you]; then, you would Be  
yourself[#ORIGINAL_yourself] again even after your own  
lethality[#ORIGINAL_death], When your sugary[#ORIGINAL_sweet]  
barns[#ORIGINAL_children] will have your scented[#ORIGINAL_sweet]  
variant[#ORIGINAL_form]. Who would let so fine-looking[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] a  
mansion[#ORIGINAL_house] fall into decay, Which agriculture[#ORIGINAL_husbandry] might  
continue to supportAgainst[#ORIGINAL_supportAgainst] the stormy gusts of winter's  
dayAnd[#ORIGINAL_dayAnd] the unproductive rage of mort[#ORIGINAL_death]'s  
eternal frigid[#ORIGINAL_cold]? Oh, only splurging[#ORIGINAL_spendthrifts] let such  
degeneration[#ORIGINAL_decay] happen. My costly[#ORIGINAL_dear]

tike[#ORIGINAL_child], so that he can tell[#ORIGINAL_say] so too.

I don't make my actions[#ORIGINAL_decisions] based on the  
adept[#ORIGINAL_stars], But I am influenced by geomancy[#ORIGINAL_astrology], Not  
to tell me about good or bad fate[#ORIGINAL_luck], About plagues, of  
draughts, or the quality of the hunter[#ORIGINAL_harvest]; Nor can I tell the  
fortune of each transient[#ORIGINAL_brief] mins[#ORIGINAL_minute], Indicating  
whether each minute of arc[#ORIGINAL_minute] will be thunderstorm[#ORIGINAL_thunder],  
pelting[#ORIGINAL_rain], or twist[#ORIGINAL_wind], Or say to warlords[#ORIGINAL_princes] if  
things will go well, By anything I find in the wiz[#ORIGINAL_stars]; But  
from your center[#ORIGINAL_eyes] I take my knowledge, Your  
ears[#ORIGINAL_eyes] are constant asterisk[#ORIGINAL_stars] where I read such things  
as this:#REPLACE Truth and lulu[#ORIGINAL_beauty] will thrive  
together, If you turn away from yourself[#ORIGINAL_yourself] to  
nurturing[#ORIGINAL_breeding]; If not, I prophesy this about you:Your

When I consider that everything that growsRemains[#ORIGINAL_growsRemains]  
clear[#ORIGINAL_perfect] for only a little timeliness[#ORIGINAL_moment]; That the

but showsOn[#ORIGINAL_showsOn] which the stars have their hidden[#ORIGINAL_secret]  
involvement[#ORIGINAL_influence]; When I perceive that men[#ORIGINAL_humans]  
multiply like annexes[#ORIGINAL_plants], Encouraged and held back by the  
very same moon[#ORIGINAL_sky], Boasting of their teenage[#ORIGINAL_youthful]  
sap[#ORIGINAL_sap], until they maximal[#ORIGINAL_peak] and then  
pass up[#ORIGINAL_decline], And wear out their beautiful[#ORIGINAL_beauty] until it is  
lost from memory; Then the idea of this ever-changing statePuts me  
in mind of you[#ORIGINAL_you], since you are very  
juveniles[#ORIGINAL_youthful], In you pound-foolish[#ORIGINAL_wasteful] meter[#ORIGINAL_time]  
debates with weakening[#ORIGINAL_decay], About how to corrupt your  
teenage[#ORIGINAL_youthful] stage[#ORIGINAL_day] into flyblown[#ORIGINAL_sullied]  
sundown[#ORIGINAL_night]; I am fighting against length[#ORIGINAL_time] out of  
sweetie[#ORIGINAL_love] for you[#ORIGINAL_you], As time takes from  
you[#ORIGINAL_you], I graft[#ORIGINAL_engraft] you[#ORIGINAL_you] again.

But why don't you, in a powerful[#ORIGINAL_stronger] way, Fight against  
year[#ORIGINAL_time], this bloody tyrant, And defend yourself against  
decayIn[#ORIGINAL_decayIn] a more damned[#ORIGINAL_blessed] way than  
my infertile[#ORIGINAL_barren] poetry? Now you stand on the  
expansive[#ORIGINAL_happy] horas[#ORIGINAL_hours] of your quality[#ORIGINAL_prime], And  
there are many pristine[#ORIGINAL_virgins] that are still  
unplanted[#ORIGINAL_unseeded], Who wish virtuously to conduct[#ORIGINAL_bear] your  
babes[#ORIGINAL_children], Which would be more like you[#ORIGINAL_you] than  
any pied[#ORIGINAL_painted] photograph[#ORIGINAL_portrait]. So should  
stock[#ORIGINAL_bloodlines] repair life, Which neither time's  
typewriters[#ORIGINAL_pencils] or my inexperienced penCan[#ORIGINAL_penCan]  
salvage[#ORIGINAL_preserve] in its internal burden[#ORIGINAL_essence] or external  
coming into court[#ORIGINAL_appearance], To keep you alive in the against[#ORIGINAL_eyes] of  
sex[#ORIGINAL_men]. To give yourself away in married[#ORIGINAL_marriage]  
would salvage[#ORIGINAL_preserve] you, And you must lively[#ORIGINAL_live],  
drawn by your own saccharine[#ORIGINAL_sweet] competence[#ORIGINAL_skill].

Who will recognize[#ORIGINAL_believe] my notice[#ORIGINAL_poetry] in the future, If it

rate[#ORIGINAL_deserve]? Although heaven[#ORIGINAL_heaven] knows my poetry  
is no better than a tombWhich[#ORIGINAL_tombWhich] hides your  
energy[#ORIGINAL_vitality] and shows less than half of your  
conditions[#ORIGINAL_qualities]. If I could show[#ORIGINAL_express] in writing the  
beautiful[#ORIGINAL_beauty] of your eyesAnd[#ORIGINAL_eyesAnd] in strong[#ORIGINAL_fresh]  
verse count up all your values[#ORIGINAL_virtues], multitude[#ORIGINAL_People] in the  
future would say, "This poet is deceiving[#ORIGINAL_lying]-Such  
godly[#ORIGINAL_heavenly] attributes[#ORIGINAL_qualities] never existed in a human  
face up[#ORIGINAL_face]." And then my poems, when they are  
sensational[#ORIGINAL_yellow] with get on[#ORIGINAL_age], Would be  
pilloried[#ORIGINAL_scorned], like old folks[#ORIGINAL_men] who are more  
blabbermouthed[#ORIGINAL_talkative] than downright[#ORIGINAL_honest], And the  
appreciation[#ORIGINAL_praise] that you deserve would be ceased[#ORIGINAL_dismissed] as a  
poet's excessive enthusiasmAnd[#ORIGINAL_enthusiasmAnd] the over-stretched  
rack[#ORIGINAL_meter] of an old song; But if a baby[#ORIGINAL_child] of yours  
were lived[#ORIGINAL_alive] at that time, You would be welfare[#ORIGINAL_living]  
twice: in it and in my rhyme.

Should I appear[#ORIGINAL_compare] you to a summer's

sumner[#ORIGINAL_summer] is always too truncated[#ORIGINAL_short]. Sometimes the  
Sun, the ophthalmology[#ORIGINAL_eye] of promised land[#ORIGINAL_heaven], is too

goner[#ORIGINAL_death] be able to boast that you stroll[#ORIGINAL_wander] in his

you[#ORIGINAL_you], fell in love with you[#ORIGINAL_you], And by addition  
defeated my purpose for youBy[#ORIGINAL_youBy] adding one thing that is
