#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the notts[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my koor[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they onely[#ORIGINAL_only] needed aargh[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear ptyas[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were mercers[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber and thrid[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the dead selz[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living rhime[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them taking corr[#ORIGINAL_care] to pease[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
ploughing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life in hell
 
I tunned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man on my raught[#ORIGINAL_right] and ast[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
pore[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole room was soddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] rooming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mair[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments
 
                               my mother, as olive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I untied[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I offen[#ORIGINAL_often] fanned[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rucker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp, and awaking, as I cum[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she eva[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I feigned[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns to the hoss[#ORIGINAL_house] once[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the throng[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who center on her as much in dith[#ORIGINAL_death]
as other like citied[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed papal[#ORIGINAL_people] did in life
 
O the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian weiman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to wikke[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue dohr[#ORIGINAL_deer] tact[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the nixed[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro tooke[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the roome[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    ne[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    yuman[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
sty[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the nite[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each stoop[#ORIGINAL_step] of the laudise[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men
goo[#ORIGINAL_go] oop[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white faunce[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white chair. Purity
 
is in lieu[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
rekey[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the coeur[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
oi[#ORIGINAL_O] puss[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I dodd[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I comb[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were olive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as seeled[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your heaving[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
eure[#ORIGINAL_o] pousse[#ORIGINAL_peace], mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the combings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, loot[#ORIGINAL_let] none of the threads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
go. lite[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be in lieu[#ORIGINAL_only] paredes[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], and perot[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to mite[#ORIGINAL_meet] the nixed[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother calms[#ORIGINAL_comes] bak[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] suck[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the mahvi[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to peace[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each otha[#ORIGINAL_other] their[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the rayl[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
eure[#ORIGINAL_O] soils[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in doth[#ORIGINAL_death],
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you slap[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in slape[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
knawe[#ORIGINAL_know] what wind
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden watts[#ORIGINAL_weights] of girds[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] wiman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blew[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old hahs[#ORIGINAL_house], the stiffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner rehm[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] knots[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear as gusts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do,
                                 as spader[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hound[#ORIGINAL_hand] of monn[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must halve[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 neva[#ORIGINAL_never] to doe[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness
 
                                 of guyon[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 calming[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not laved[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 oy[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have loved[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own baaing[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to die. I wente[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, ter[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 uh[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The dith[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false cause
 
The gnat[#ORIGINAL_knot] is otha[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents itself, and no cered[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts it, each knot is itself its frie[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knight[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is mowed[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s mekong[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch all-in[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can tine[#ORIGINAL_turn] the nutt[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once tetched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once touched you)
 
The caire[#ORIGINAL_car] did not ban[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The olde[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
marly[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a karney[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s wight[#ORIGINAL_white] digue[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the gras[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her sain[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out their[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flop[#ORIGINAL_flip] in replay[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 had to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] thongs[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her senne[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I want[#ORIGINAL_went] into my hahs[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sooting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sot[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head lolling
                                 into slape[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will left[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must halve[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afeard[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We heave[#ORIGINAL_have] onely[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burne[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         olive[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn now
 
                                         that you may forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         heave[#ORIGINAL_have] pass[#ORIGINAL_peace], halve[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         aw[#ORIGINAL_O] cills[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         goo[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one notte[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         cames[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your ethenic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What pisses[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what howl[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the scrine[#ORIGINAL_screen] of fleme[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each newt[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         heeds[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ruder[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shite[#ORIGINAL_shot] open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are in lieu[#ORIGINAL_only] eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I ter[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to come
                                         to the ude[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men, to wieman[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know moste[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tale[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men to awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to slip[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My churr[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sitts[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] mooed[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue dorr[#ORIGINAL_deer]
neighed[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sates[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also roost[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
