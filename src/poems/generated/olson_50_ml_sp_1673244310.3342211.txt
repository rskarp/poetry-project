#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
aware[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleepin[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] air.
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were messes[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber and thread[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously longing[#ORIGINAL_clinging] altogether[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, garnered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola, and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I tuned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man on my light[#ORIGINAL_right] and tasked[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the hole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and presentations
of brake[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings and outher[#ORIGINAL_other] automobile[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories, cardboard
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], as[#ORIGINAL_as] live[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the mouse[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often sound[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I found out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown yong[#ORIGINAL_young] who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as[#ORIGINAL_as] much[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like suited and dressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] womyn[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angeln[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught in the net, in the immense[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which sprad[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plate[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each step[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a white chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfecting[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the plate[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get here[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my mother, I do not know
how indifferently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face[#ORIGINAL_face] to the light[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] solid, and your flesh[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the coamings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are tangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], let[#ORIGINAL_let] the power into the last crinkle[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let[#ORIGINAL_let] none[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and rubber of the tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth. Let even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is unhappiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], and poder[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other here[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the real is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death[#ORIGINAL_death],
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know[#ORIGINAL_know] what wind
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase of the ugly automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away[#ORIGINAL_away], cleans[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] heights[#ORIGINAL_weights] of gods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must have the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never to die, the ghastness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, turning[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instances[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not liked[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have loved[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] beine[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to make that instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, slip[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death[#ORIGINAL_death] in life[#ORIGINAL_life] (death[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false pause[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is other wise[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological conner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
resent[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s masking[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched me
 
                          o[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not represented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corps[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a conner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a chil[#ORIGINAL_child]’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the glass[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipper[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out there on the glass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] aplastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] things[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my mouse[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always[#ORIGINAL_always] had sat[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? aware[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are might[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We have[#ORIGINAL_have] only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your inauthentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] handy[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is yearth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the skreen[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only external[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men, to women most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to womyn[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell
                                         men[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         aware[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the conner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled away.
