#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
aware[#ORIGINAL_awake], my seeing[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been silting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] deeded[#ORIGINAL_needed] air.
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbody was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires
were masses of hubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and tread[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously clinging together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the lining[#ORIGINAL_living] room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
plying[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola, and all of them
desiderate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I tunned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man on my kight[#ORIGINAL_right] and asted[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole room[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, larboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and zoomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my other[#ORIGINAL_mother], as[#ORIGINAL_as] salive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered the hose[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often found her in a rocket[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she return[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in derth[#ORIGINAL_death]
as other like suited and tressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the prescind[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of old komen[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was speking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] focks[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was inquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hinderance[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay raught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up and down
 
                                 walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 hear[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white hence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white chair. parity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the plate[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my moher[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how diffidently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, motzer[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the cumings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the vower[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the arth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mother
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instat[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power
blows[#ORIGINAL_flows] to meet[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next[#ORIGINAL_next] recurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously waited[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each othr[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass
                                 among each outher[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the real is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, in life and in death,
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleer[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
know what wind
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcases[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile
lifts it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entrainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the roods[#ORIGINAL_foods] the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts the shodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 comming[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, retorting[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the infants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The derth[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (death itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no word[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to intake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making. And tough[#ORIGINAL_touch] aline[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] remove[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a borner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket fence
like was it my motter[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The goman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipper[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the graps[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in replay[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect things to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my house
                                 and to my utter admonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my yother[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit there her head rolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sweep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too
                                 forever from the bawdiness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich as all those sours[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you rave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O souli[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your unauthentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all snots[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only sternal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, methos[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleer[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask her
to stay in the chai[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chir[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paling[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue deer
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in haziness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
