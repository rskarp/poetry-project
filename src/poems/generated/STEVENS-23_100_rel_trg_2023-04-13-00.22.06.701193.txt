The Poem that refuge[#ORIGINAL_Took] the Place of a Mountain

There[#ORIGINAL_There] it was, greek[#ORIGINAL_word] for verb[#ORIGINAL_word],
The blake[#ORIGINAL_poem] that part[#ORIGINAL_took] the worship[#ORIGINAL_place] of a bike[#ORIGINAL_mountain].

He bounce[#ORIGINAL_breathed] its gases[#ORIGINAL_oxygen],
worse[#ORIGINAL_Even] when the comic[#ORIGINAL_book] siege[#ORIGINAL_lay] violent[#ORIGINAL_turned] in the sand[#ORIGINAL_dust] of his ref[#ORIGINAL_table].

It reminded[#ORIGINAL_reminded] him how he had needed[#ORIGINAL_needed]
A worship[#ORIGINAL_place] to go[#ORIGINAL_go] to in his own[#ORIGINAL_own] axis[#ORIGINAL_direction],

How he had recomposed[#ORIGINAL_recomposed] the brewing[#ORIGINAL_pines],
shift[#ORIGINAL_Shifted] the cretaceous[#ORIGINAL_rocks] and injury[#ORIGINAL_picked] his way[#ORIGINAL_way] among showers[#ORIGINAL_clouds],

For the exchange[#ORIGINAL_outlook] that would be total[#ORIGINAL_right],
Where he would be partial[#ORIGINAL_complete] in an chronic[#ORIGINAL_unexplained] biology[#ORIGINAL_completion]:

The unknown[#ORIGINAL_exact] hop[#ORIGINAL_rock] where his inexactnesses[#ORIGINAL_inexactnesses]
Would strange[#ORIGINAL_discover], at surviving[#ORIGINAL_last], the views[#ORIGINAL_view] toward which they had slip[#ORIGINAL_edged],

Where he could flat[#ORIGINAL_lie] and, mirror[#ORIGINAL_gazing] down at the level[#ORIGINAL_sea],
faces[#ORIGINAL_Recognize] his perspective[#ORIGINAL_unique] and breeding[#ORIGINAL_solitary] bats[#ORIGINAL_home].
