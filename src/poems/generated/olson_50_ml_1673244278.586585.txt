#BEGIN
As the insensitive[#ORIGINAL_dead] predatory[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping activities[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I get-up-and-go[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my auto[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been standing[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so yearlong[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I was[#ORIGINAL_thought] the gravel[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they once[#ORIGINAL_only] taken[#ORIGINAL_needed] beam[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the posterior[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires
were fans[#ORIGINAL_masses] of gum elastic[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and stream[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously clutched[#ORIGINAL_clinging] general[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead individual[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the experience[#ORIGINAL_living] court[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to slip by[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the bundling[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector, some book[#ORIGINAL_record]
joking[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the bakelite[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the venality[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life in hell
 
I addressed[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the girlish[#ORIGINAL_young] piece[#ORIGINAL_man] on my rightist[#ORIGINAL_right] and entrusted[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t propose[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
slummy[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the major[#ORIGINAL_whole] indoor[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly bill[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations
of brake overlays[#ORIGINAL_linings] and different[#ORIGINAL_other] automotive accomplices[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as jaded[#ORIGINAL_bored] back in life as they are in hell, poor and damn[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere teams[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my parent[#ORIGINAL_mother], ac[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, inattentive[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I recruit[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the light[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and stumbling[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came up to her, as she ever given[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she returns to the house once a decade[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the unknown junior[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as much in death
as other like suited and dressed to the nines[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did in spirit[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
pubis[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    used[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the chromatic[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to tread[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the puritan[#ORIGINAL_blue] gray squirrel[#ORIGINAL_deer] spoken[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the additional[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro utter[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the crushing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of nonagenarian[#ORIGINAL_old] womenfolk[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was seeking shoes[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or crt[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its rumps[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human being[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five interference[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] guards[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
refrain[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the purification[#ORIGINAL_net], in the major[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nett[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which halt[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each tread[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the magi[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the vices[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and trio[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the tosser[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the ondes martenot[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be zipped[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white anchor[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white vice-chairman[#ORIGINAL_chair]. impeccant[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only an imperative[#ORIGINAL_instant] of remaining[#ORIGINAL_being], the bond[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
metastasize[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five barriers[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall generate[#ORIGINAL_get] approximately[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
dnv[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my grandma[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how appropriately[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have finished[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I undertook[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not bash[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are rearward[#ORIGINAL_back] each decade[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you free-fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] dozy[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I accomplished[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as illuminated[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I defined[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the keep company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your take[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all come[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
red letter day[#ORIGINAL_o] peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the arrival[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the heads[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life-style[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my lifeblood[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the power into the close[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, help[#ORIGINAL_let] objection[#ORIGINAL_none] of the sequences[#ORIGINAL_threads] and tubing[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the frameworks[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the planet[#ORIGINAL_earth]. cease[#ORIGINAL_Let] likewise[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
expire[#ORIGINAL_go]. put[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be singly[#ORIGINAL_only] eden[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The despair[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the wink[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is actually[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is glad[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves
into the next instant, and potency[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to adjoin[#ORIGINAL_meet] the last[#ORIGINAL_next] incident[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any beseech[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother add up[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly attain[#ORIGINAL_seek] the crib[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not condemn[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously sought[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each certain[#ORIGINAL_other] however[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the tangible[#ORIGINAL_real] is, equally[#ORIGINAL_even] to the spectacle[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
planum[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, in age[#ORIGINAL_life] and in goner[#ORIGINAL_death],
make, also[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
too[#ORIGINAL_even] under the driveshaft[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly motors[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
plagiarize[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it back[#ORIGINAL_away], bright[#ORIGINAL_clears] the soupy[#ORIGINAL_sodden] balances[#ORIGINAL_weights] of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian milady[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy northern[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the ethereality[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old house, the stuffed single[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts the unplayable[#ORIGINAL_sodden] mechanisms[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they obliterate[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as beasties[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] set[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as immobilizer[#ORIGINAL_spider] canvas[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must need[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall life[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 constantly[#ORIGINAL_never] to survive[#ORIGINAL_die], the wretchedness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming backwards[#ORIGINAL_back], recovering[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants which were not faced[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have proceed[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have dwelled[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you knew[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself equalized[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own being
 
                                 I hope[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I feel[#ORIGINAL_want] to shuffle[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 perfective[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O my psychology[#ORIGINAL_soul], cutting[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog

The death in future[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the unjustified[#ORIGINAL_false] cause
 
The bond[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other advisable[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological corner
presents itself, and no seif[#ORIGINAL_sword]
snub[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the feet[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake
the granny knot[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s making. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its respective[#ORIGINAL_own] love[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          coxa[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The lorry[#ORIGINAL_car] did not scorch[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not conferred[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque carcass[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The oldish[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
purely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a road[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket close[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my sire[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s whiteness[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the gage[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her his[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next potter[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 foundered[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had outside[#ORIGINAL_out] there on the plant[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was really[#ORIGINAL_quite] rotate[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to except[#ORIGINAL_expect] assertions[#ORIGINAL_things] to pallet[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t gold[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her daughter[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been ruin[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was precisely[#ORIGINAL_just] thus[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my place[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my entire[#ORIGINAL_utter] disdain[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she usually[#ORIGINAL_always] had sat, as must she also[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 finally[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit too[#ORIGINAL_there] her school principal[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my dad[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what gauge[#ORIGINAL_wind] will overturn[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 establish[#ORIGINAL_make] you well-to-do[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those somebody[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 thirst[#ORIGINAL_crave] thirst[#ORIGINAL_crave] esurine[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be ample[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are starboard[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must request[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We induce[#ORIGINAL_have] but[#ORIGINAL_only] one line[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets which illaqueate[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         trigonum[#ORIGINAL_O] hearts[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         reanimated[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn at once[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may once[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have peace, ensure[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O lives[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         put[#ORIGINAL_let] not one puzzle[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass
                                         through your hands[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must suspended[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the tenderloin[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell on earth[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be dwelling[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the white[#ORIGINAL_screen] of candle[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each knot
                                         hides as all cammas[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a envelope[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready
                                         to be shot undetermined[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are entirely[#ORIGINAL_only] eternal if you sleeper[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too foretell[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the counselling[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men, to womanly[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know farthest[#ORIGINAL_most], to exwife[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell
                                         men to awakening[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, troops[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake
 
I instruct[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to sleeper[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I require[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to let[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the gavel[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My professorship[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the patch[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the corral[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She leans[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of clearing[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The sexy[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
ask[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will simultaneously[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The volvo[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been tossed[#ORIGINAL_hauled] aside[#ORIGINAL_away].
