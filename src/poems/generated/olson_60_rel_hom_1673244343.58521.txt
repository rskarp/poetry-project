#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] pray[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangle[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed my kahr[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so[#ORIGINAL_so] long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed ere[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses of rubber and thread variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the dead sowles[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living rheaume[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them taking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector[#ORIGINAL_projector], some reckard[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young mahn[#ORIGINAL_man] on my write[#ORIGINAL_right] and assed[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other[#ORIGINAL_other] automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bored[#ORIGINAL_bored] bak[#ORIGINAL_back] in life[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I offen[#ORIGINAL_often] found her in a rocker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lampe[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I found out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the hauss[#ORIGINAL_house] once[#ORIGINAL_once] a wieck[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as[#ORIGINAL_as] much in death
as other like suited[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people[#ORIGINAL_people] did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
au[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the Indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blew[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] rheaume[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walke[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the reaume[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] menne[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the nett[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plain[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] netz[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each stepp[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and menn[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 wok[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked into a korner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the white fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instant[#ORIGINAL_instant] of being[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O peace, my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently I could have done[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not dew[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are bak[#ORIGINAL_back] each weick[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face[#ORIGINAL_face] to the rite[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I cum[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I new[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the compagnie[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the cummings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The netz[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my sowle[#ORIGINAL_soul], let[#ORIGINAL_let] the power[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let[#ORIGINAL_let] none of the threads and rubber of the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth. Let even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows to mete[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly seek the reaume[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously wanted[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each other[#ORIGINAL_other], merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the riehl[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
eau[#ORIGINAL_O] sowles[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make, even as you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods[#ORIGINAL_foods] the Indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy blew[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 foote[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old hauss[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner[#ORIGINAL_inner] rheaume[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] netz[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] dew[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of mann[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never[#ORIGINAL_never] to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 coming bak[#ORIGINAL_back], returning[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants which were not lived[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, to[#ORIGINAL_too],

The death[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (death itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] kaus[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knott[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other[#ORIGINAL_other] wyse[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] koerner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no soard[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts it, each notte[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each not[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the nett[#ORIGINAL_net] is made[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hannes[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake
the not[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s making. And touch alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the not[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flame
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          eaux[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The olde[#ORIGINAL_old] manne[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a koerner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the pickett[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s wight[#ORIGINAL_white] dog[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the gras[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her sun[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next doerr[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she hadd[#ORIGINAL_had] out their[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 hadd[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect things[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and brake[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her sun[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 downe[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then[#ORIGINAL_then] I wente[#ORIGINAL_went] into my hauss[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] their[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit there her head lolling
                                 into sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those soles[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are rite[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must halve[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We halve[#ORIGINAL_have] only one course:
 
the nets which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O souls, burne[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive[#ORIGINAL_alive], burne[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         halve[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O sowles[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one nott[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         comes through your authentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what helle[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each nott[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides as all knots are a wal[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the netz[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] eternal if you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I to[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to cum[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aide[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all menne[#ORIGINAL_men], to women[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         menn[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the koerner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sitts[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the soles[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled away[#ORIGINAL_away].
