Infanta Marina

Her taiwanese[#ORIGINAL_terrace] was the water[#ORIGINAL_sand]
And the laurel wreath[#ORIGINAL_palms] and the daybreak[#ORIGINAL_twilight].
 
She shed[#ORIGINAL_made] of the gestures[#ORIGINAL_motions] of her elbow[#ORIGINAL_wrist]
The fanciful[#ORIGINAL_grandiose] initiatives[#ORIGINAL_gestures]
Of her belief[#ORIGINAL_thought].
 
The ravel[#ORIGINAL_rumpling] of the blobs[#ORIGINAL_plumes]
Of this animate being[#ORIGINAL_creature] of the prom[#ORIGINAL_evening]
grew[#ORIGINAL_Came] to be edgehill[#ORIGINAL_sleights] of part[#ORIGINAL_sails]
Over the seaside[#ORIGINAL_sea].
 
And this[#ORIGINAL_thus] she marauded[#ORIGINAL_roamed]
In the traveling[#ORIGINAL_roamings] of her pressure[#ORIGINAL_fan],

drinking[#ORIGINAL_Partaking] of the submarine[#ORIGINAL_sea],
And of the late[#ORIGINAL_evening],
As they dripped[#ORIGINAL_flowed] around
And blurted[#ORIGINAL_uttered] their abates[#ORIGINAL_subsiding] auditory sensation[#ORIGINAL_sound].
