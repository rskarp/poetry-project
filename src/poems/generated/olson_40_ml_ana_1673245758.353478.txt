#BEGIN
As the dead prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] ari[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their file[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned to the young man[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right and asked, “How is it,
there[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room was suddenly posters and presentations
of break[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dead roaming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back[#ORIGINAL_back] in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often found[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she returns to the house once[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the throng[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown young[#ORIGINAL_young] who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much in death
as other[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each step[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white[#ORIGINAL_white] fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white[#ORIGINAL_white] chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the rac[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently I could have done[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mother
go. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes back?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly seek the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might except[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the rale[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in file[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
wonk[#ORIGINAL_know] what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, sarcle[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden weights[#ORIGINAL_weights] of goods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner room
lifts the sodden nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back[#ORIGINAL_back], returning
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The death in file[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is endless, eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false sauce[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is other wise[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological corner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making. And touch alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its own flame[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out[#ORIGINAL_out] there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect things[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and brake[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her nso[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my house
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had tas[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever sit there her head lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the screen[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only eternal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep as your hands[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away[#ORIGINAL_away].
