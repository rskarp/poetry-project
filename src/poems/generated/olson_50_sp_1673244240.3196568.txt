As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
aware[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping ones[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been titting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so long unused.
I thought the tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires] jooked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only neded[#ORIGINAL_needed] air.
But suddenly the huge underboss[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tres[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were passes[#ORIGINAL_masses] of bubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread viciously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taping[#ORIGINAL_taking] care[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the motie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some rekord[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desiderate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriest[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life in hell
 
I turnes[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man on my righ[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
twere[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protectingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the whole room was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and presentations
of brake linings and oher[#ORIGINAL_other] automative[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories, corkboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displant[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and roomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my motzer[#ORIGINAL_mother], as alive as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocher[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she return[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the ouse[#ORIGINAL_house] once[#ORIGINAL_once] a week[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throg[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown yoing[#ORIGINAL_young] who tenter[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as[#ORIGINAL_as] much[#ORIGINAL_much] in dearth[#ORIGINAL_death]
as ither[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed people[#ORIGINAL_people] did in life[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
O the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer] tasked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walkin[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gibber[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of dammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was geeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] pocks[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was reacquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human impossibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the net, in the immerse[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step[#ORIGINAL_step] of the larders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels
and the demono[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up and down
 
                                 walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackals[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked into a cosner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the white bence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the rammel[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is bidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the plaice[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minuter[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O peace, my other[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have done[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the wight[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used to your hiving[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the copings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] crinkle[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let none of the threads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and grubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the earth. let[#ORIGINAL_Let] even your mother
go. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is campiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant, and power
blows[#ORIGINAL_flows] to meet[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any worder[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother omes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 wightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 nappiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complains[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wafted[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each oher[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each othr[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the real is, even to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] soult[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in sleep
know[#ORIGINAL_know] what wind
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcases[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away[#ORIGINAL_away], cleans[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodded[#ORIGINAL_sodden] wrights[#ORIGINAL_weights] of woods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the Indian toman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the headiness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old house, the stuffed inher[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as seider[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 naver[#ORIGINAL_never] to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the hastiness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 coming back, retrying[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instates[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have rived[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself letted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own bling[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to make that instat[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (neath[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] lause[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other wise, each topologic[#ORIGINAL_topological] coroner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is made[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s maling[#ORIGINAL_making]. And tough[#ORIGINAL_touch] alore[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flamme[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once torched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o moter[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once toughed[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burn. Its undersize[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not repented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corps[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket sence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother’s whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] dog[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s choir[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The wman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 plating[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grads[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her son[#ORIGINAL_son] (the womac[#ORIGINAL_woman] next door[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was aggry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 blipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out[#ORIGINAL_out] there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was cuite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 had to exect[#ORIGINAL_expect] things to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and brea[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t warry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her son[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent[#ORIGINAL_sent] ridding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my houss[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my moter[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever sit twere[#ORIGINAL_there] her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling
                                 into sweep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? awave[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my pother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are light[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one courbe[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] which untangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your bingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must leep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         cames[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your unauthentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What pauses[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is erth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         vides[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot[#ORIGINAL_shot] open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] external[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep as your handi[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to womyn[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to boman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to sleep. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the chain[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobiles[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled away[#ORIGINAL_away].
