#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But miraculously[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the abundant[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of raincoat[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the vault[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the prurience[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole sitting[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, board[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
has[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere implements[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her equally[#ORIGINAL_as] much in death
as different[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled the dark[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the colorful[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a buster[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was wandering[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hurt[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a segregated[#ORIGINAL_white] meat[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is still[#ORIGINAL_only] an incumbent[#ORIGINAL_instant] of moment[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I wanted[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I tell[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, make[#ORIGINAL_let] none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let then[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they tangibly[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the presentation[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life-style[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make, even as you snooze[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in kip[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the odious[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobile
lifts it away, clears the damp[#ORIGINAL_sodden] poundage[#ORIGINAL_weights] of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue stalker[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to wilt[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, landslide[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each polynomial[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the snare[#ORIGINAL_net] is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s preparation[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          coccyx[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not char[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and insert[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner of the picket defensive[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child’s rocker[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the bassinet[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out there on the daisy[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t preoccupy[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I directed[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit approximately[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what meander[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too
                                 forever from the salaciousness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn here[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O consciences[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         facilitate[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         buries[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be agitated[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most
                                         who informed[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue roes[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The motorbike[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled away.

I, Maximus of Gloucester, to You
Off-shore, by islands hidden in the blood   
                                        jewels & miracles, I, Maximus
                                        a metal hot from boiling water, tell you   
                                        what is a lance, who obeys the figures of   
                                        the present dance
 
1
the thing you’re after
may lie around the bend
of the nest (second, time slain, the bird! the bird!
And there! (strong) thrust, the mast! flight

the roofs, the old ones, the gentle steep ones
on whose ridge-sticks[#ORIGINAL_poles] the gulls sit, from which they depart,
 
                                                                  And the flake-racks
of my city!

love is anatomy[#ORIGINAL_form], and cannot be without   
important substance (the weight
say, 58 carats each one of us, perforce   
our goldsmith’s scale
 
                                           feather to quill[#ORIGINAL_feather] added
                                           (and what is mineral, what
                                           is cross[#ORIGINAL_curling] hair, the string
                                           you carry in your nervous beak, these

                                           the combination[#ORIGINAL_sum]
 
                                           (o my lady of good voyage

the underpart is, though stemmed, uncertain

be played by, said he, coldly, the
heed[#ORIGINAL_ear]!
 
By ear, he sd.
But that which thing[#ORIGINAL_matters], that which insists, that which will last,
that! o my people, where shall you find it, how, where, where shall you listen
when all is become billboards, when, all, even silence, is spray-gunned?
 
when even our seabird[#ORIGINAL_bird], my shatterproof glass[#ORIGINAL_roofs],   
cannot be heard
 
when even you, when sound itself is neoned in?
 
when, on the hill, over the water
where she who used to sing,
when the water beaming[#ORIGINAL_glowed],   
black, gold, the tide   
externally[#ORIGINAL_outward], at goodnight[#ORIGINAL_evening]
 
when bells came like boats   
over the oil-slicks, milkweed   
hulls
 
And a bro[#ORIGINAL_man] slumped,   
attentionless,
against pink shingles
 
o sea city)

one loves only form,
and form only comes
into existence when
the thing is born
 
                           born of yourself, born
                           of hay and cotton struts,
                           of street-pickings, wharves, weeds   
                           you carry in, my bird
 
                                                            of a bone of a fish   
                                                            of a straw, or will   
                                                            of a color, of a bell   
                                                            of yourself, torn

love is not easy
but how shall you know,
New England, now
that pejorocracy is here, how
that street-cars, o Oregon, twitter

a black-gold loin?
 
                              how shall you strike,
                              o swordsman, the blue-red colored[#ORIGINAL_black]   
                              when, last night, your aim
                              was mu-sick, mu-sick, mu-sick   
                              And not the cribbage amusement[#ORIGINAL_game]?
