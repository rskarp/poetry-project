#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] noes[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused.
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the strie[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only needed ria[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear treis[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously clinging together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of kaber[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor[#ORIGINAL_poor] and doomed
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, a s[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I found[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as threo[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to lawk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue deer talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the romo[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men and angels
stay caught in the etn[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each pset[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the desmon[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instant[#ORIGINAL_instant] of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the capel[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes aelt[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother, I do not wonk[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each kwee[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o[#ORIGINAL_o] peace, mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let[#ORIGINAL_let] the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth. Let even your thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death,
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the dahn[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 never[#ORIGINAL_never] to die, the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] ebing[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the flase[#ORIGINAL_false] cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corren[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can turn the kton[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] fleam[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched me
 
                          o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a child’s iachr[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit there her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass
                                         through your fringes[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the sencer[#ORIGINAL_screen] of melfa[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each tonk[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be tosh[#ORIGINAL_shot] open by you
 
                                                                               the ntse[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men, to women most
                                         who know msot[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to lelt[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men to awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the iachr[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My richa[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
