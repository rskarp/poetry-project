#BEGIN
As the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey upon us,
they are the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] weans[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my car, it had been seating[#ORIGINAL_sitting] c[#ORIGINAL_so] long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the towers[#ORIGINAL_tires] lacked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only kneaded[#ORIGINAL_needed] ayr[#ORIGINAL_air].
But soddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbidder[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the ruhr[#ORIGINAL_rear] tawas[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were mercies[#ORIGINAL_masses] of raber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the loving[#ORIGINAL_living] rhime[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking kahre[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass
beneath the beam of the mahvi[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some rikard[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their liffe[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned to the young mane[#ORIGINAL_man] on my raught[#ORIGINAL_right] and ast[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
their[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he bigged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
pear[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole rheem[#ORIGINAL_room] was soddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of breck[#ORIGINAL_brake] leanings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and otha[#ORIGINAL_other] automotive accessories, cardboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displease[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored bak[#ORIGINAL_back] in liff[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, pore[#ORIGINAL_poor] and dumbed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mair[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as olive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as eva[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered the house as I often feigned[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lumpp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I comb[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she iver[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I found out she retains[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the hass[#ORIGINAL_house] once[#ORIGINAL_once] a walke[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown yong[#ORIGINAL_young] who santer[#ORIGINAL_center] on her ose[#ORIGINAL_as] much in doth[#ORIGINAL_death]
as otha[#ORIGINAL_other] like sauteed[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people died[#ORIGINAL_did] in lief[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
ae[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] wieman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    ennobled[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blow[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to wikke[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue darr[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked,
                    in the nixed[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jacchus[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its tak[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of olde[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the rheum[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was soaking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] sikes[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    humane[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay coit[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets
which spread out across each plein[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets
which hamper at each stipp[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladies[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the daimons[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
gaw[#ORIGINAL_go] oop[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 walke[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 hoar[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola
                                 Let the otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tacked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a cornu[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the wheat[#ORIGINAL_white] faunce[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] chirr[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only an instant[#ORIGINAL_instant] of baaing[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels
 
rekey[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the ploss[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t new[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the corr[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall got[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
eau[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently I could have dern[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not dough[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are bak[#ORIGINAL_back] each whelk[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you foyle[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your fuss[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right
 
                                 that you are persant[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were olive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are ose[#ORIGINAL_as] seeled[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your heaving[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all fanned[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
aw[#ORIGINAL_o] peace, mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the cumings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of laff[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are untangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my seel[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the power into the laced[#ORIGINAL_last] ronchil[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let non[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rebbe[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the toews[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the uthe[#ORIGINAL_earth]. lout[#ORIGINAL_Let] even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go. Let there be onely[#ORIGINAL_only] paredes[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and p a[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to mete[#ORIGINAL_meet] the nixed[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wunder[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother cames[#ORIGINAL_comes] bak[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the rhame[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of luff[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously wintered[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each otha[#ORIGINAL_other], marly[#ORIGINAL_merely] to poss[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other their[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the real is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The peveto[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O souls, in laugh[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
mak[#ORIGINAL_make], even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
new[#ORIGINAL_know] what wound[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the agley[#ORIGINAL_ugly] otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weitz[#ORIGINAL_weights] of gades[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the fides[#ORIGINAL_foods] the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] werman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blow[#ORIGINAL_blue] dour[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nates[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as speedo[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vaunt[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must hove[#ORIGINAL_have] the vaunt[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghostliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of garone[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 combing[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not laved[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 ow[#ORIGINAL_O] mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have laved[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself nutted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my eigne[#ORIGINAL_own] bowing[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to dough[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to make that instant, to[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 oi[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, slap[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog

The death in luff[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The nett[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other wyse[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword
cuts it, each nutt[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each nutt[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the nett[#ORIGINAL_net] is med[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the henze[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s macing[#ORIGINAL_making]. And titch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can tine[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its eigne[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] tetched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The coar[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] carps[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old moan[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
marly[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I lucked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and pert[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a karney[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket faunce[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s wet[#ORIGINAL_white] dague[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The wiemann[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 ploughing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the gruss[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her sen[#ORIGINAL_son] (the wiemann[#ORIGINAL_woman] next derr[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out their[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 had to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] thongs[#ORIGINAL_things] to skied[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her sown[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hoot[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was jest[#ORIGINAL_just] then I went into my hasse[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my outie[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 funned[#ORIGINAL_found] my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother] suiting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] their[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always[#ORIGINAL_always] had suit[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit there her head lolling
                                 into slapp[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wende[#ORIGINAL_wind] will loafed[#ORIGINAL_lift] you to[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those cells[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are rote[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot afeard[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We halve[#ORIGINAL_have] only one course:
 
the nets which untangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         O sells[#ORIGINAL_souls], bane[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         olive[#ORIGINAL_alive], ban[#ORIGINAL_burn] na[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         hove[#ORIGINAL_have] piece[#ORIGINAL_peace], hove[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O sowles[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         lette[#ORIGINAL_let] not one neat[#ORIGINAL_knot] poss[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         loot[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         calms[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your ethenic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What pusses[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hyle[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is auth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rant[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knight[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides as all knots are a wall redeye[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot up on[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nats[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are onely[#ORIGINAL_only] atonal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep as your hinze[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be buzzy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too kohl[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to comb[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the ode[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all mean[#ORIGINAL_men], to weimann[#ORIGINAL_women] mossed[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who knawe[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to woman to teel[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         maneh[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, mein[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the cornu[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the faunce[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the fireplace mad[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] staines[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blew[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need not tribal[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the cells[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble her and me
will also roast[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled away.
