Spring and All: XI [In loops[#ORIGINAL_passing] with my thoughts[#ORIGINAL_mind]]

In lap[#ORIGINAL_passing] with my brain[#ORIGINAL_mind]
on nothing in the wrestling[#ORIGINAL_world]
 
but the angle[#ORIGINAL_right] of way[#ORIGINAL_way]
I fun[#ORIGINAL_enjoy] on the terminus[#ORIGINAL_road] by
 
ranking[#ORIGINAL_virtue] of the constitutional[#ORIGINAL_law]        
I decline[#ORIGINAL_saw]
 
an sick[#ORIGINAL_elderly] isle[#ORIGINAL_man] who
smiled[#ORIGINAL_smiled] and like[#ORIGINAL_looked] net[#ORIGINAL_away]
 
to the yorkshire[#ORIGINAL_north] past a built[#ORIGINAL_house] 
a lover[#ORIGINAL_woman] in grey[#ORIGINAL_blue]
 
who was bird[#ORIGINAL_laughing] and
lean[#ORIGINAL_leaning] reverse[#ORIGINAL_forward] to forward[#ORIGINAL_look] up
 
into the elms[#ORIGINAL_mans] dozen[#ORIGINAL_half]
resumed[#ORIGINAL_averted] facial[#ORIGINAL_face]
 
and a nintendo[#ORIGINAL_boy] of eight who was
something[#ORIGINAL_looking] at the dorsum[#ORIGINAL_middle] of
 
the automobile[#ORIGINAL_mans] coloration[#ORIGINAL_belly]
at a watchchain[#ORIGINAL_watchchain] 
 
The reversed[#ORIGINAL_supreme] earnest[#ORIGINAL_importance]
of this grave[#ORIGINAL_nameless] audiences[#ORIGINAL_spectacle]
 
pitch[#ORIGINAL_sped] me by them
without a syllable[#ORIGINAL_word] 
 
Why knock[#ORIGINAL_bother] where I lose[#ORIGINAL_went] ?
for I went mules[#ORIGINAL_spinning] on the
 
four tires[#ORIGINAL_wheels] of my laps[#ORIGINAL_car]
along the freshwater[#ORIGINAL_wet] cycling[#ORIGINAL_road] until
 
I decline[#ORIGINAL_saw] a love[#ORIGINAL_girl] with one copa[#ORIGINAL_leg]
over the terminus[#ORIGINAL_rail] of a basilica[#ORIGINAL_balcony]
