The Poem that shot[#ORIGINAL_Took] the Place of a Mountain

far[#ORIGINAL_There] it was, text[#ORIGINAL_word] for logos[#ORIGINAL_word],
The haiku[#ORIGINAL_poem] that undertook[#ORIGINAL_took] the base[#ORIGINAL_place] of a hillside[#ORIGINAL_mountain].

He wafted[#ORIGINAL_breathed] its tank[#ORIGINAL_oxygen],
regular[#ORIGINAL_Even] when the script[#ORIGINAL_book] pose[#ORIGINAL_lay] did[#ORIGINAL_turned] in the smudge[#ORIGINAL_dust] of his tile[#ORIGINAL_table].

It drew[#ORIGINAL_reminded] him how he had done[#ORIGINAL_needed]
A position[#ORIGINAL_place] to pass[#ORIGINAL_go] to in his different[#ORIGINAL_own] focus[#ORIGINAL_direction],

How he had reconstructed[#ORIGINAL_recomposed] the oaks[#ORIGINAL_pines],
pitch[#ORIGINAL_Shifted] the hitting[#ORIGINAL_rocks] and taken[#ORIGINAL_picked] his route[#ORIGINAL_way] among taint[#ORIGINAL_clouds],

For the look[#ORIGINAL_outlook] that would be straight[#ORIGINAL_right],
Where he would be terminated[#ORIGINAL_complete] in an unexpressed[#ORIGINAL_unexplained] ending[#ORIGINAL_completion]:

The detailed[#ORIGINAL_exact] careen[#ORIGINAL_rock] where his inconsistency[#ORIGINAL_inexactnesses]
Would observe[#ORIGINAL_discover], at up-to-date[#ORIGINAL_last], the attention[#ORIGINAL_view] toward which they had rallied[#ORIGINAL_edged],

Where he could blah[#ORIGINAL_lie] and, strolling[#ORIGINAL_gazing] down at the offshore[#ORIGINAL_sea],
know[#ORIGINAL_Recognize] his unequaled[#ORIGINAL_unique] and stand-alone[#ORIGINAL_solitary] home plate[#ORIGINAL_home].
