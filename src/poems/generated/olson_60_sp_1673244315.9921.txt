#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sheeting[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangle the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my car[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unfused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tires looted[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed air[#ORIGINAL_air].
But sudden[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbids[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear wires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were gasses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber and thread vacuously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging untogether[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead fouls[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living room[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them talking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movic[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some secord[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola, and all of them
asperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned to the young man[#ORIGINAL_man] on my richt[#ORIGINAL_right] and aked[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
therf[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whore[#ORIGINAL_whole] room[#ORIGINAL_room] was sullenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters[#ORIGINAL_posters] and preservations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake vinings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automative[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessaries[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bored back[#ORIGINAL_back] in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my nother[#ORIGINAL_mother], as live[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the hous[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often bound[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a recker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came up to her, as she ever had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she returns to the house once[#ORIGINAL_once] a week[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the unknown young who renter[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as tother[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and tressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the indign[#ORIGINAL_Indian] doman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer] balked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like talking[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jack-ass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing jabber[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of gamers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old[#ORIGINAL_old] womyn[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was geeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shots[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hoover[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was inquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    huan[#ORIGINAL_human] impossibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hinderance[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the net[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each slane[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiped[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which pamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each step of the ladders as the mangels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackals[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 hear[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 let[#ORIGINAL_Let] the automobilia[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be ducked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a white clair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instat[#ORIGINAL_instant] of beinn[#ORIGINAL_being], the grammes[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recut[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrance[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the plac[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minuses[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O preace[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how indifferently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your face[#ORIGINAL_face] to the dight[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o[#ORIGINAL_o] phace[#ORIGINAL_peace], moter[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and gorings[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the badders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], let[#ORIGINAL_let] the powr[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last winkle[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let[#ORIGINAL_let] none of the treads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the tres[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the darth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. let[#ORIGINAL_Let] even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] parvise[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instat[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolved[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant, and power
glows[#ORIGINAL_flows] to meet[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next[#ORIGINAL_next] incurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any woner[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother comed[#ORIGINAL_comes] back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that thron[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly seek[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously wanked[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movpe[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The povert[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O soule[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know[#ORIGINAL_know] what wind
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away, chears[#ORIGINAL_clears] the shodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] wrights[#ORIGINAL_weights] of golds[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment, the roods[#ORIGINAL_foods] the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman,
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stiffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] nner[#ORIGINAL_inner] room[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifes[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodded[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as hosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as seider[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 4ever[#ORIGINAL_never] to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lied[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mothe[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you did[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] bejing[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instat[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death[#ORIGINAL_death] in life[#ORIGINAL_life] (neath[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] cauce[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is other wise, each horological[#ORIGINAL_topological] dorner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net[#ORIGINAL_net] is made
is for the handa[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untame[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s making. And mouch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can turn the knot into its own flambe[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once touches[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o[#ORIGINAL_o] mothed[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] pouched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its undersize[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presence[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corse[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 plying[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the gras[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her son[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 flipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out[#ORIGINAL_out] there on the grams[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was cuite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] thingo[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and breau[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t lorry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her son[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skiing[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my housse[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother silting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] theyre[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always had sat[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] therf[#ORIGINAL_there] her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling
                                 into sleep? aware[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awave[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the bawdiness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crase[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are light[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which estrangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flamens[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] soules[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] sols[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your zingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must sweep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         comed[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your unauthentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hanes[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What posses[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is narth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screet[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall leady[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot[#ORIGINAL_shot] open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] sternal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you bleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your nands[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men, to momen[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to koman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell
                                         men[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to sleep. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chain[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplaces[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the sauls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away[#ORIGINAL_away].
