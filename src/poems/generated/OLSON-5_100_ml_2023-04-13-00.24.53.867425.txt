Maximus, to Glouchester: memorandum[#ORIGINAL_Letter] 2

. . . . . speak[#ORIGINAL_tell] you? ha! who
can recite[#ORIGINAL_tell] another how

the brightness[#ORIGINAL_light], yet[#ORIGINAL_there], at the barrio[#ORIGINAL_corner] (because of the bounteous[#ORIGINAL_big] bat[#ORIGINAL_elm]
and the bringing[#ORIGINAL_reflecting] casa[#ORIGINAL_houses]) spring[#ORIGINAL_winter] or zomer[#ORIGINAL_summer] resides[#ORIGINAL_stays]
as it was when they stayed[#ORIGINAL_lived] furthermore[#ORIGINAL_there], in the habitation[#ORIGINAL_house] the pedestrian[#ORIGINAL_street] crosscut[#ORIGINAL_cuts] off
as though it were a problem[#ORIGINAL_fault],
the faces[#ORIGINAL_sides] else[#ORIGINAL_so] mere[#ORIGINAL_sheer]

they unmasked[#ORIGINAL_hid], or looked[#ORIGINAL_tried] to enshroud[#ORIGINAL_hide], the thing[#ORIGINAL_fact] the load[#ORIGINAL_cargo] their maritime[#ORIGINAL_ships] asked[#ORIGINAL_brought] back
was calamitous[#ORIGINAL_black] (the Library, majorly[#ORIGINAL_too], absolutely[#ORIGINAL_possibly] and then[#ORIGINAL_so] built[#ORIGINAL_founded]). The steer[#ORIGINAL_point] is

the luminance[#ORIGINAL_light] does blend in[#ORIGINAL_go] one vehicle[#ORIGINAL_way] toward the mails[#ORIGINAL_post] role[#ORIGINAL_office],
and quite another evolution[#ORIGINAL_way] down to Main Street. Nor is that all:

emerging[#ORIGINAL_coming] from the ocean[#ORIGINAL_sea], all[#ORIGINAL_up] Middle, it is furthermore[#ORIGINAL_more] dilute[#ORIGINAL_white], distinctly[#ORIGINAL_very] yellow[#ORIGINAL_white]
as it conveys[#ORIGINAL_passes] the greywater[#ORIGINAL_grey] of the deistic[#ORIGINAL_Unitarian] temple[#ORIGINAL_church]. But at Pleasant Street,
it is steeply[#ORIGINAL_abruptly]

(He
pack[#ORIGINAL_made] the coastguard[#ORIGINAL_coast], and though he misplaced[#ORIGINAL_lost] his meter[#ORIGINAL_feet] for it,
and the manos[#ORIGINAL_hands] hestonewall[#ORIGINAL_d] unknowingly[#ORIGINAL_purposely] tolerated[#ORIGINAL_allowed] to paralyze[#ORIGINAL_freeze] to the oarsmen[#ORIGINAL_oars],
I remembered[#ORIGINAL_knew] him, consume[#ORIGINAL_drank]
with my aging[#ORIGINAL_elders], in his local[#ORIGINAL_own] taproom[#ORIGINAL_bar], a loaf[#ORIGINAL_toast] to him

Or my added[#ORIGINAL_other], the arch[#ORIGINAL_top] of whose scratch[#ORIGINAL_head] a mooring[#ORIGINAL_bollard] neat[#ORIGINAL_clean] wanted[#ORIGINAL_took] apart[#ORIGINAL_away].
It was four skies[#ORIGINAL_days] before they could develop[#ORIGINAL_get] him to Chelsea Marine.
This springtime[#ORIGINAL_spring] I check out[#ORIGINAL_listened] to him inanely[#ORIGINAL_as] effective[#ORIGINAL_good] as newborn[#ORIGINAL_new], bias[#ORIGINAL_as] natural[#ORIGINAL_fresh] as its entirely[#ORIGINAL_always] been
to publicize[#ORIGINAL_hear] him lecture[#ORIGINAL_talk] of the marine[#ORIGINAL_sea]. He was rummaging[#ORIGINAL_puttering] in his waterfall[#ORIGINAL_garden] when I gave[#ORIGINAL_came] up,
outlook[#ORIGINAL_looking] over his Santa Fe climb[#ORIGINAL_rose]. And he grew[#ORIGINAL_took] off his hood[#ORIGINAL_hat] to tell[#ORIGINAL_show] me,
how it is all coloring[#ORIGINAL_skin] where his stegosaur[#ORIGINAL_skull] was,
excessively[#ORIGINAL_too] best[#ORIGINAL_much] of a pickle[#ORIGINAL_hole] for straight[#ORIGINAL_even] the state-of-the-art[#ORIGINAL_newest] metalwork[#ORIGINAL_metal]
to blanket[#ORIGINAL_cover]

Or the silent[#ORIGINAL_quiet] each[#ORIGINAL_one], whos deceased[#ORIGINAL_died] since (hospitalized[#ORIGINAL_died] as rooftop[#ORIGINAL_deck]-guardian[#ORIGINAL_watchman], on his sailboat[#ORIGINAL_vessel], in ship[#ORIGINAL_port]).
summers[#ORIGINAL_Years] back[#ORIGINAL_ago] I vista[#ORIGINAL_heard] from outsiders[#ORIGINAL_others]
how hekiddy[#ORIGINAL_d] stopped[#ORIGINAL_pulled] two outfit[#ORIGINAL_men] out of the seabed[#ORIGINAL_sea] one tomorrow[#ORIGINAL_night]
off Eastern Point. Theyrun out[#ORIGINAL_d] not been empowered[#ORIGINAL_able] to clarify[#ORIGINAL_shed] their ports[#ORIGINAL_jacks]
when the blimp[#ORIGINAL_ship] dropped[#ORIGINAL_went] less[#ORIGINAL_over], and when he drew[#ORIGINAL_caught] them
they were come[#ORIGINAL_going] down actually[#ORIGINAL_too]. He shoved[#ORIGINAL_hauled] them into Braces Cove,
true[#ORIGINAL_even] though the flank[#ORIGINAL_shore] wasnt though[#ORIGINAL_there], it was such a blizzard[#ORIGINAL_storm] and the eez[#ORIGINAL_sea] systematic[#ORIGINAL_so] huge[#ORIGINAL_big]
it had capsized[#ORIGINAL_turned] the Lily Pond
into an backwater[#ORIGINAL_arm] of itself.

Last, he with enforcer[#ORIGINAL_muscle] equally[#ORIGINAL_as] humongous[#ORIGINAL_big] as his view[#ORIGINAL_voice], the durability[#ORIGINAL_strength] of him
in that snowdrifts[#ORIGINAL_blizzard]
to have pluck[#ORIGINAL_pulled] the browse[#ORIGINAL_trawl] slack off[#ORIGINAL_slack] from the completely[#ORIGINAL_very] bed[#ORIGINAL_bottom] and assuaged[#ORIGINAL_released]
his pal[#ORIGINAL_mate] from the haddock[#ORIGINAL_cod]-crochet[#ORIGINAL_hook] account[#ORIGINAL_had] him out, and just about[#ORIGINAL_almost] near[#ORIGINAL_off],
into the cushioning[#ORIGINAL_snow]. It wasnt that there ate[#ORIGINAL_was] thusly[#ORIGINAL_so] entire[#ORIGINAL_much] coast[#ORIGINAL_sea]. It was the inhumane[#ORIGINAL_cold],
and that clad[#ORIGINAL_white], until over the wharf[#ORIGINAL_dory] blew[#ORIGINAL_went] and the two of them,
one even so[#ORIGINAL_still],
were in. The tempestuous[#ORIGINAL_wild] entity[#ORIGINAL_thing] was, he cast[#ORIGINAL_made] the navigation[#ORIGINAL_vessel], three mills[#ORIGINAL_miles], and pull in[#ORIGINAL_fetched] her,
contained[#ORIGINAL_found] that tank[#ORIGINAL_vessel] in all that temperature[#ORIGINAL_weather], with his compatriot[#ORIGINAL_fellow] all in[#ORIGINAL_dead] firepower[#ORIGINAL_weight]
on him. The form[#ORIGINAL_sort] of eyepiece[#ORIGINAL_eye]
which ago[#ORIGINAL_later] feared[#ORIGINAL_knew] the Peak of Browns
as though it were his respective[#ORIGINAL_own] yard[#ORIGINAL_garden] (as Bowditch comprised[#ORIGINAL_brought] the Eppie Sawyer
descry[#ORIGINAL_spot] to her slip[#ORIGINAL_wharf] a Christmas matinee[#ORIGINAL_morning])

Which is the frost[#ORIGINAL_cream] of the juice[#ORIGINAL_milk], of realization[#ORIGINAL_course]. And the lait[#ORIGINAL_milk]
already[#ORIGINAL_also] of the one[#ORIGINAL_matter], the better[#ORIGINAL_most] of it, those
who accomplish[#ORIGINAL_do] no else[#ORIGINAL_more] than beer[#ORIGINAL_drink] it in a cutting[#ORIGINAL_cup] of social[#ORIGINAL_tea] calm[#ORIGINAL_alone] of such a blackness[#ORIGINAL_night], summons[#ORIGINAL_holding]
(as she)
a sure as shooting[#ORIGINAL_certain] whaler[#ORIGINAL_schooner]

What however[#ORIGINAL_still] is, in alternative[#ORIGINAL_other] things[#ORIGINAL_words]. And the distinguished[#ORIGINAL_remarkable] start[#ORIGINAL_part] of it,
that it withal[#ORIGINAL_still] run[#ORIGINAL_goes] on, at rest[#ORIGINAL_still] is
what account[#ORIGINAL_counts]:

 the kiddy[#ORIGINAL_lad] from the Fort
who late[#ORIGINAL_recently] rented[#ORIGINAL_bought] the lowly[#ORIGINAL_small] white family[#ORIGINAL_house] on Lower Middle
(the incomparable[#ORIGINAL_one] perpendicularly[#ORIGINAL_diagonally] across from the loveable[#ORIGINAL_handsome] mason[#ORIGINAL_brick] with the Bullfinch lock[#ORIGINAL_door])
He reached[#ORIGINAL_stood] with me one Sunday
and eyed (with a pretend[#ORIGINAL_like] oculus[#ORIGINAL_eye]) a intriguing[#ORIGINAL_curious] fleet[#ORIGINAL_ship]
wed both descend[#ORIGINAL_come] on, associated[#ORIGINAL_tied] to the Gas Company waterfront[#ORIGINAL_wharf].
She had lashed[#ORIGINAL_raked] lighthouse[#ORIGINAL_masts], and they were unsteepled[#ORIGINAL_unstepped],
built[#ORIGINAL_fitted] free[#ORIGINAL_loose] in her adorn[#ORIGINAL_deck], like a hallway[#ORIGINAL_neck] in a rabat[#ORIGINAL_collar].
He was view[#ORIGINAL_looking] contently[#ORIGINAL_idly], as I was, talking[#ORIGINAL_saying] nothing.
When nakedly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly], he became[#ORIGINAL_turned] to a Gloucesterman, a super[#ORIGINAL_big] yat[#ORIGINAL_one],
landed[#ORIGINAL_berthed] alongside this strange[#ORIGINAL_queer] yat[#ORIGINAL_one], and note[#ORIGINAL_said]:
Ill belong[#ORIGINAL_own] her, one tomorrow[#ORIGINAL_day]

While she look[#ORIGINAL_stares], out of her clown[#ORIGINAL_painted] eye[#ORIGINAL_face],
not[#ORIGINAL_no] matter[#ORIGINAL_matter] the mortal[#ORIGINAL_deathly] shang[#ORIGINAL_mu]-disgusted[#ORIGINAL_sick], the applying[#ORIGINAL_demand]
will foment[#ORIGINAL_arouse]
some of these tomorrow[#ORIGINAL_men] and lady[#ORIGINAL_women]
