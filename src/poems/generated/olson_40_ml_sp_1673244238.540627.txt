#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sleepin[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangler[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so[#ORIGINAL_so] long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously longing[#ORIGINAL_clinging] altogether[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the laving[#ORIGINAL_living] room[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector, some record
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the bawdiness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I tuned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man[#ORIGINAL_man] on my light[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
here[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the hole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and presentations
of brake linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bored back in life[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor[#ORIGINAL_poor] and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the bouse[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often[#ORIGINAL_often] fond[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns to the houss[#ORIGINAL_house] once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death[#ORIGINAL_death]
as other like suited and dressed people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    -enabled[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hinderance[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men[#ORIGINAL_men] and anges[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper at each step[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels
and the demons
and men
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] the automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of beine[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammeler[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfecting[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have done
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were live[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the coamings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are intangle[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, let[#ORIGINAL_let] the poder[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let[#ORIGINAL_let] none[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and rubber of the tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the yearth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is unhappiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows[#ORIGINAL_flows] to meet[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously waited[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each other, merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The povert[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
know what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even under the crankcase of the ugly automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away, cleans[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] heights[#ORIGINAL_weights] of foods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment, the goods[#ORIGINAL_foods] the Indian woman,
the filthy blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 foot[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the meatiness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old house, the stuffed inner[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must have the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 ever[#ORIGINAL_never] to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of doing[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have liked[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own beine[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to make that instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], too[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eviternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] cause
 
The knot is outher[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each homological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents itself, and no swerd[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net[#ORIGINAL_net] is made[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s masking[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its own flambe[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] dog[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slopped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out[#ORIGINAL_out] here[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used aplastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had to expect things[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and bread[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my houss[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] here[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always[#ORIGINAL_always] had sat[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit there her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, aware[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are might[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have[#ORIGINAL_have] only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flares[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         live[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic handy[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the skreen[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only external[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you slep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the aid[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men[#ORIGINAL_men], to womyn[#ORIGINAL_women] most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         aware[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the chair.
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the conner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of paving stones[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest. The automotive[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away.
