#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] seno[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my acr[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only needed air.
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] treis[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and red hat[#ORIGINAL_thread] savourily[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the living[#ORIGINAL_living] omor[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young[#ORIGINAL_young] man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole moro[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back[#ORIGINAL_back] in file[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, a s[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often found her in a rocker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the malp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I mace[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
as other like setuid[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue deer talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro kalt[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing grabbe[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of grammes[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old[#ORIGINAL_old] women[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    hamun[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] nme[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white rachi[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant[#ORIGINAL_instant] of ebing[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes aelt[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have doen[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not d o[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your face to the right[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] solid[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your shelf[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of fiel[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the slat[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let none of the dearths[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the tires
be left upon the rathe[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. etl[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek[#ORIGINAL_seek] the ormo[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of fiel[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie], each threo[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make, even as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in peels[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know what dwin[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase of the guly[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobile
flits[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away, sarcle[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue rede[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old house, the stuffed inner moro[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they appraised[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The tenv[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never[#ORIGINAL_never] to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming[#ORIGINAL_coming] back[#ORIGINAL_back], returning
                                 to the instants which were not deliv[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my now[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, oot[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my ouls[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog

The hedta[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (theda[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the flase[#ORIGINAL_false] cause
 
The kton[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other wise, each topological corner
presents[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no drows[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts it, each kton[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the tonk[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own fleam[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its undesired[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child[#ORIGINAL_child]’s cahir[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had uot[#ORIGINAL_out] there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who sued[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had to expect things[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her son might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I snet[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had ast[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit there[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what dwin[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave cerva[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave
 
                                 to be hirc[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O lusso[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must plese[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the etn[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hlle[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is taher[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be ernt[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the screen[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each kont[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         shied[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] teneral[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you peels[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, mothed[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I oot[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the iad[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all nme[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to lelt[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         emn[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I aks[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corren[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the fireplace[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls
who trouble her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled away[#ORIGINAL_away].
