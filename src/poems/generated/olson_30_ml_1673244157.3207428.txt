#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping aspects[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
unknot[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been conference[#ORIGINAL_sitting] amen[#ORIGINAL_so] long uncollected[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I notice[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tires looked as though they only used[#ORIGINAL_needed] atmospheric[#ORIGINAL_air].
But then[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the voluminous[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear flat tire[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses of glue[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread disparagingly[#ORIGINAL_variously] adhering[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the tired[#ORIGINAL_dead] ghosts[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the modern[#ORIGINAL_living] room, derived[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them taking charge[#ORIGINAL_care] to evanesce[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the projection[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record
exercising[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the upright piano[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the triteness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are mean[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the whole room was of a sudden[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, tin[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored bet on[#ORIGINAL_back] in anima[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere amenities[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as full of life[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lighting[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and dozing[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came up to her, as she since[#ORIGINAL_ever] faced[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she deliver[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week, and with her
the volge[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown young who center on her as best[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as complementary[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed masses[#ORIGINAL_people] came[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the inac[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to climb[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the dispiriting[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro interact[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its chat[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped run[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its feet[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human prospects[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men and apostles[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay flared[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense redes[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which stretch[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each whole tone[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
turn[#ORIGINAL_go] up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the jukebox[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be squirreled[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white railing[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white chair. Purity
 
is pure[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of underway[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five impedimenta[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 transcripts[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t understanding[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get though[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
O rate[#ORIGINAL_peace], my folks[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently I could have received[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall fast asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your shoulder[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were animated[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as good[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I got[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you deserve[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used to your throw[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all feel[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a smartness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life-style[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, wait[#ORIGINAL_let] the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let regular[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go. show[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be still[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is indeed[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is treasure[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves
into the next split second[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power
flows to touch[#ORIGINAL_meet] the imminent[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother fall[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the suite[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 well-being[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain
                                 of lifecycle[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously expected[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each respective[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the certain[#ORIGINAL_real] is, anymore[#ORIGINAL_even] to the indication[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death,
form[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the slushy[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the dry[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they eliminate[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as trace[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do,
                                 as spider networking[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the evolution[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 following[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the nanosecond[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not saw[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O get[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have prepared[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you wrote[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I demand[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 osmium[#ORIGINAL_O] my character[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The agony[#ORIGINAL_death] in lifespan[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the lucre[#ORIGINAL_net] is tailor[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making. And pinch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can turn the hub[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flame
 
                          (o mum[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had previously[#ORIGINAL_once] touched me
 
                          big screen[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once hurt[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not scorched[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its rear[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not laid[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
necessarily[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my native[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white toto[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The womanliness[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 tinkering[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the herbaceous[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she received[#ORIGINAL_had] out there on the daisy[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 account[#ORIGINAL_had] to rely[#ORIGINAL_expect] things to skid
 
                                 and interrupt[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went into my place[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my let loose[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever remains[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, active[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 consistently[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the crudity[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 lust[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crave
 
                                 to be colourful[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must give[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we prefer[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We stimulate[#ORIGINAL_have] only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         idiomatic[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have appeasement[#ORIGINAL_peace], have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         endure[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must off[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the mesh[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic manpower[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be leaseback[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the screen of excitement[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each knot
                                         exposes[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are exclusively[#ORIGINAL_only] eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I well[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to matrons[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who knowledge[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, sex[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake
 
I propose[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to seduce[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask her
to stay in the professorship[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the corner of the concluding[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She hangs[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the grate[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she crouches[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The motor[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been draw[#ORIGINAL_hauled] externally[#ORIGINAL_away].
