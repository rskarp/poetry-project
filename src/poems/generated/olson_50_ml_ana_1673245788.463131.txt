#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping nose[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my rac[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so[#ORIGINAL_so] long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] ari[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] souls in the living[#ORIGINAL_living] room[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young[#ORIGINAL_young] man[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right and asked[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the whole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in file[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to meer[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often[#ORIGINAL_often] found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much[#ORIGINAL_much] in death[#ORIGINAL_death]
as other[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed people[#ORIGINAL_people] did in life
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the Indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer talked,
                    in the next room[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the net[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper at each step[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a white chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant[#ORIGINAL_instant] of being, the trammels[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t wonk[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the acr[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of file[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the power into the lsat[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let none[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and rubber of the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the earth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows[#ORIGINAL_flows] to mete[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seke[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of file[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the real is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, in life and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
know what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden weights of goods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old[#ORIGINAL_old] house[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming[#ORIGINAL_coming] back[#ORIGINAL_back], returning
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you did[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog

The death[#ORIGINAL_death] in file[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] sauce[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is other[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making. And touch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot into its own flame[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The acr[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corpse[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog?
 
or a child[#ORIGINAL_child]’s chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her nso[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out[#ORIGINAL_out] there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to except[#ORIGINAL_expect] things to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her nso[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had tas[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit there[#ORIGINAL_there] her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], have
 
                                         what you crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to shoot[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides as all knots are a wall[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready
                                         to be shot[#ORIGINAL_shot] open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all men, to women[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the fence[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the fireplace made[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile
 
has been hauled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away.
