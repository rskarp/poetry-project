#BEGIN
As the dead pray[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my car, it had been sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so long unused.
I thought the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber and thread variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] souls in the living reaume[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young[#ORIGINAL_young] man on my write[#ORIGINAL_right] and ast[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor
poore[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the hole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the hauss[#ORIGINAL_house] as I offen[#ORIGINAL_often] found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I found[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the hause[#ORIGINAL_house] once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who center on her as much in death[#ORIGINAL_death]
as other like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to wok[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blew[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer talked,
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the reaume[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the nett[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plain[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each steppe[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and menne[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a koerner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the white fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a wight[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the karr[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not dew[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The netz[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my sowle[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let[#ORIGINAL_let] nuhn[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the earth. Let even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes bak[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other their[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the real is, even to the display cards[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death[#ORIGINAL_death],
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods,
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the olde[#ORIGINAL_old] house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of manne[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must halve[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 eaux[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you did[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my sohl[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death in life (death[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a korner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a child[#ORIGINAL_child]’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass,
                                 with her sun[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next dore[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she hadd[#ORIGINAL_had] out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my house
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich as all those soles[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must halve[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burne[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         au[#ORIGINAL_O] souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the nett[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hannes[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hehl[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wahle[#ORIGINAL_wall] ready
                                         to be shot open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hans[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I to[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to cum[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aide[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all menn[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who know[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to woman to tell[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made of paving stones. The blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sitts[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
