#BEGIN# 
We want gorgeous[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] mass[#ORIGINAL_people] to reproduce and  
grow in keep down[#ORIGINAL_number], So that the examples of  
looker[#ORIGINAL_beauty] might never die. Even though someone who  
is intense[#ORIGINAL_ripe] must eventually perish[#ORIGINAL_die], His young  
heiress[#ORIGINAL_heir] might carry his recollection[#ORIGINAL_memory]. But you, bound  
in a contract to your own dishy[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] peeper[#ORIGINAL_eyes], Are  
burning up your own pulchritude[#ORIGINAL_beauty] by being single, Are making  
a desertification[#ORIGINAL_famine] where there is vast[#ORIGINAL_abundance], You are  
your own belligerent[#ORIGINAL_enemy], too rude[#ORIGINAL_cruel] to your  
saccharine[#ORIGINAL_sweet] self. You, who are now the original[#ORIGINAL_fresh]  
flower[#ORIGINAL_ornament] of the world, And the best mark[#ORIGINAL_herald] of  
the splashy[#ORIGINAL_ostentatious] spring, Are burying your  
beau[#ORIGINAL_beauty] within an unused button[#ORIGINAL_bud], You are being a  
girly beggar[#ORIGINAL_miser], wasting your pulchritude[#ORIGINAL_beauty] by being so  
cheeseparing[#ORIGINAL_stingy]. Show some regret[#ORIGINAL_pity] on the world, or else  
become a fiend[#ORIGINAL_glutton], By letting what the world deserves be  
spent[#ORIGINAL_consumed] by the grave and you[#ORIGINAL_you].

When forty snows[#ORIGINAL_winters] will lodge in[#ORIGINAL_occupy] your  
forehead, And dig deep trenches the battlefield[#ORIGINAL_field] that  
smasher[#ORIGINAL_beauty] now occupies, The proud sleepwear[#ORIGINAL_clothing] of  
your youth, so impressed[#ORIGINAL_admired] by else[#ORIGINAL_others] now, Will  
be cracked[#ORIGINAL_ripped] tease[#ORIGINAL_rags], considered to be worth  
little. Then when someone asks you where all your pretty[#ORIGINAL_beauty]  
is, Where all the trove[#ORIGINAL_treasure] of your sexually active days  
lies, To say that it lies within your own deep-sunken  
chin[#ORIGINAL_eyes], Would be an all-consuming disgrace[#ORIGINAL_shame] and  
wasteful of accolade[#ORIGINAL_praise]. The role[#ORIGINAL_use] of your  
pretty[#ORIGINAL_beauty] would deserve so much more praiseIf[#ORIGINAL_praiseIf]  
you could resolution[#ORIGINAL_answer]:  "This pulchritudinous[#ORIGINAL_beautiful]  
kid[#ORIGINAL_child] of mineIs the receive[#ORIGINAL_receipt] of my  
dish[#ORIGINAL_beauty] and the exempt[#ORIGINAL_excuse] for my  
antiquity[#ORIGINAL_oldness]. "And his sweetheart[#ORIGINAL_beauty] will be proved  
because he is your boy[#ORIGINAL_son]. This little girl[#ORIGINAL_child] would be  
teenage[#ORIGINAL_youthful] when you are senile[#ORIGINAL_old], You would see  
your blood line[#ORIGINAL_blood] warm when you feel it growing cold.

another, If you do not renew your attractiveness[#ORIGINAL_beauty] by passing it  
on, You cheat the globe[#ORIGINAL_world], and sacrificator[#ORIGINAL_unbless] some  
grandmother[#ORIGINAL_mother]. There is no woman whose unused  
wombWould[#ORIGINAL_wombWould] refuse your agriculture[#ORIGINAL_husbandry] of  
her?And who is so scatterbrained[#ORIGINAL_foolish] that he will make a  
tombOut[#ORIGINAL_tombOut] of his self-love, to stop himself having  
survivors[#ORIGINAL_heirs]. You are the mirror image of your  
bring forth[#ORIGINAL_mother], and youRecall the lovely bounce[#ORIGINAL_spring]-time  
of her youth. Similarly, you will be able to see with your own  
eyes, Despite your old ageism[#ORIGINAL_age], this golden timekeeping[#ORIGINAL_time] of  
your youth. But if you lively[#ORIGINAL_live] as if you don't want to  
be remembered, You perish[#ORIGINAL_die] mateless[#ORIGINAL_single] and your  
epitome[#ORIGINAL_image] will die with you.

Wasteful beaut[#ORIGINAL_beauty], why do you  
spendThe intestacy[#ORIGINAL_inheritance] of your good-looking[#ORIGINAL_beauty] upon  
yourself?Nature's giver[#ORIGINAL_gift] is nothing in itself, it is  
paid[#ORIGINAL_lent], And, being unstinting[#ORIGINAL_generous], she lends to those  
who are unsparing[#ORIGINAL_generous]. Then, you picturesque[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] miser,  
why do you abuseThe[#ORIGINAL_abuseThe] bountiful hiring[#ORIGINAL_endowment]  
given to you to give to alternative[#ORIGINAL_others?You] profitless  
investor[#ORIGINAL_banker], why do you spendSo neat[#ORIGINAL_great] a sum,  
without making more breath[#ORIGINAL_life?By] treaty[#ORIGINAL_dealing] only  
with yourself, You betray[#ORIGINAL_deceive] your odoriferous[#ORIGINAL_sweet] self  
about your self. So when universe[#ORIGINAL_nature] calls you to be  
expended[#ORIGINAL_gone], What acceptable report[#ORIGINAL_account] of yourself  
can you leave behind?Your unused attractiveness[#ORIGINAL_beauty] will go to the  
grave[#ORIGINAL_tomb] with you, Which when considered[#ORIGINAL_used], lives to be

in snowmelt[#ORIGINAL_snow] and leaving him stark[#ORIGINAL_barren]. Then if it  
were not for the distilling[#ORIGINAL_distillation] of Summer[#ORIGINAL_Summer], A  
liquid jail[#ORIGINAL_prisoner] trapped in a glass  
receptacle[#ORIGINAL_container], The effect of pulchritude[#ORIGINAL_beauty] would be lost  
with stunner[#ORIGINAL_beauty], And neither it nor any remembrance[#ORIGINAL_memory]  
of what it was. But distilled floral[#ORIGINAL_flowers], although they do

sweetly[#ORIGINAL_sweetly] lives.

Then do not let Winter[#ORIGINAL_Winter]'s rough needles[#ORIGINAL_hands]

your honey[#ORIGINAL_sweetness]; hoarded wealth[#ORIGINAL_treasure] some placeWith  
the trove[#ORIGINAL_treasure] of your sweetheart[#ORIGINAL_beauty], before it  
belt down[#ORIGINAL_kills] itself. This use of your mantrap[#ORIGINAL_beauty] is not  
forbidden like usuryBecause it makes fortunate[#ORIGINAL_happy] those who  
willingly purchase[#ORIGINAL_pay] the loan;That[#ORIGINAL_loan;That] would be the case

geez[#ORIGINAL_heavens], Resembling a well-set[#ORIGINAL_strong]  
younger[#ORIGINAL_youth] in his middle age, And inferior masters[#ORIGINAL_humans]  
still worship his grace[#ORIGINAL_beauty], Watching his golden  
route[#ORIGINAL_journey] across the hemisphere[#ORIGINAL_sky]. But when from its  
absolute[#ORIGINAL_highest] signal[#ORIGINAL_point], in a weary  
caboose[#ORIGINAL_chariot], Like weak old elderly[#ORIGINAL_age], he staggers away  
from the morrow[#ORIGINAL_day], The eyes, before so submissive[#ORIGINAL_dutiful], are  
now turned awayFrom his breakdown[#ORIGINAL_downfall] and look another

string up[#ORIGINAL_string], like a sweet widower[#ORIGINAL_husband] to  
another, Resonate with each other so they can strong[#ORIGINAL_sound] in

Is it because you don't want to make your widow cryThat[#ORIGINAL_cryThat]  
you devastate[#ORIGINAL_waste] yourself away in your unwedded[#ORIGINAL_single]

still enjoys it;However, pretty[#ORIGINAL_beauty] wasted is lost to the  
world, By the fine[#ORIGINAL_beautiful] man who keeps his

on himself.

In shame you abstain[#ORIGINAL_deny] that you passion[#ORIGINAL_love] anyone

like your own mien[#ORIGINAL_presence], which is cordial[#ORIGINAL_gracious] and  
humane[#ORIGINAL_kind], Or at least be kindly[#ORIGINAL_kind]-hearted to

when you convert it into young person[#ORIGINAL_youth]. In this, lies wisdom,  
pretty[#ORIGINAL_beauty], and growth;Without this, foolishness, old  
years[#ORIGINAL_age], and cold decadence[#ORIGINAL_decay]. If everyone thought like  
you[#ORIGINAL_you], time would cease, And the world would end in

reproduction[#ORIGINAL_breeding], Rough-#REPLACE looking,  
nondescript[#ORIGINAL_featureless], and uneducated[#ORIGINAL_uncultured], die  
childless[#ORIGINAL_childless]. See how Nature gave most to those whom she  
gave the best advantages[#ORIGINAL_qualities], A giver[#ORIGINAL_gift] full of  
mercy[#ORIGINAL_goodness] which you should dote[#ORIGINAL_cherish]  
generously. attractiveness[#ORIGINAL_Beauty] molded you as her postage stamp[#ORIGINAL_stamp],

debates with decadence[#ORIGINAL_decay], About how to corrupt your
