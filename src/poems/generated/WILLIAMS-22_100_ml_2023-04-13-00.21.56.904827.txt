Spring and All: XI [In exit[#ORIGINAL_passing] with my think[#ORIGINAL_mind]]

In overtaking[#ORIGINAL_passing] with my intent[#ORIGINAL_mind]
on nothing in the globe[#ORIGINAL_world]
 
but the reactionist[#ORIGINAL_right] of thoroughfare[#ORIGINAL_way]
I admire[#ORIGINAL_enjoy] on the roadway[#ORIGINAL_road] by
 
cause[#ORIGINAL_virtue] of the acquis[#ORIGINAL_law]        
I spoke[#ORIGINAL_saw]
 
an greatest[#ORIGINAL_elderly] humanity[#ORIGINAL_man] who
stammered[#ORIGINAL_smiled] and feel[#ORIGINAL_looked] fast[#ORIGINAL_away]
 
to the northeastern[#ORIGINAL_north] past a accommodation[#ORIGINAL_house] 
a housewife[#ORIGINAL_woman] in puritan[#ORIGINAL_blue]
 
who was chatting[#ORIGINAL_laughing] and
gravitating[#ORIGINAL_leaning] forrad[#ORIGINAL_forward] to wait[#ORIGINAL_look] up
 
into the childes[#ORIGINAL_mans] moiety[#ORIGINAL_half]
deflect[#ORIGINAL_averted] expression[#ORIGINAL_face]
 
and a sweetheart[#ORIGINAL_boy] of eight who was
outlook[#ORIGINAL_looking] at the midst[#ORIGINAL_middle] of
 
the humanity[#ORIGINAL_mans] underside[#ORIGINAL_belly]
at a watchstrap[#ORIGINAL_watchchain] 
 
The top-level[#ORIGINAL_supreme] point[#ORIGINAL_importance]
of this woebegone[#ORIGINAL_nameless] show[#ORIGINAL_spectacle]
 
decelerated[#ORIGINAL_sped] me by them
without a verb[#ORIGINAL_word] 
 
Why inconvenience oneself[#ORIGINAL_bother] where I came[#ORIGINAL_went] ?
for I went moving[#ORIGINAL_spinning] on the
 
four roll[#ORIGINAL_wheels] of my gondola[#ORIGINAL_car]
along the sweating[#ORIGINAL_wet] railroad[#ORIGINAL_road] until
 
I light[#ORIGINAL_saw] a mademoiselle[#ORIGINAL_girl] with one shank[#ORIGINAL_leg]
over the wagon[#ORIGINAL_rail] of a walkway[#ORIGINAL_balcony]
