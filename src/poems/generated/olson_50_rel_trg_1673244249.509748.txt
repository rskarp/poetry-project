#BEGIN
As the alive[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey upon us,
they are the grateful[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my wake[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my ford[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused.
I extinct[#ORIGINAL_thought] the rims[#ORIGINAL_tires] seemed[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] air.
But suddenly the hit[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear rim[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were sacred[#ORIGINAL_masses] of pads[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and cloth[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously clinging together
 
as were the dead afterlife[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living room, gathered
about my marie[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking physician[#ORIGINAL_care] to drive[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the propeller[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the premiere[#ORIGINAL_movie] device[#ORIGINAL_projector], some tie[#ORIGINAL_record]
football[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola, and all of them
abc[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their sentence[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I violent[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the woman[#ORIGINAL_young] mega[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right and comment[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he marry[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room was suddenly posters[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations
of brake linings and other auto[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories, cardboard
displays, the dying[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bored back[#ORIGINAL_back] in life as they are in hell, weather[#ORIGINAL_poor] and start[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to sufficient[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as[#ORIGINAL_as] kicking[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep
when I qualifying[#ORIGINAL_entered] the historic[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often moist[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a patch[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the stack[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I substitute[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I moist[#ORIGINAL_found] out she begins[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the historic[#ORIGINAL_house] once a week, and with her
the occasions[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown man[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as wider[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like suited and pink[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people seek[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] the injured[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the tamil[#ORIGINAL_Indian] suffrage[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the pants[#ORIGINAL_blue] civet[#ORIGINAL_deer] think[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the fastest[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro airs[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a donkey[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its hosts[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old wives[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped throw[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking scarves[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its zebra[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and christ[#ORIGINAL_angels]
overnight[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the net, in the skill[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets
which aged[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each wave[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which enemy[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each pyramid[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and women[#ORIGINAL_men]
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the detroit[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked into a porch[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the pale[#ORIGINAL_white] lizard[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white sciences[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instant of being[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, ultimate[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is bonus[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes afternoon[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 footage[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall reformed[#ORIGINAL_get] there[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my parents[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not hear[#ORIGINAL_know]
how different[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not do[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back each yards[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you love[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I fruition[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] crystal[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your eat[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I happened[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the corporation[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, cousin[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the comings and goings
of the wwe[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of insurance[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are violate[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, suppose[#ORIGINAL_let] the power into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let poverty[#ORIGINAL_none] of the periphery[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the friction[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the goddess[#ORIGINAL_earth]. assume[#ORIGINAL_Let] though[#ORIGINAL_even] your teacher[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. hear[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only casino[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the camera[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next celebrity[#ORIGINAL_instant], and rangers[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the next occurring[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my tongue[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 wrongly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 misery[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not lack[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the pictures[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other[#ORIGINAL_other], merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] to exam[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the imaginary[#ORIGINAL_real] is, though[#ORIGINAL_even] to the lcd[#ORIGINAL_display] screening[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The rates[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, in expectancy[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
difference[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleep, though[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
know what speed[#ORIGINAL_wind]
though[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away, clears the metal[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods,
equipment, industry[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the cuisine[#ORIGINAL_foods] the Indian women[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the normandy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] pink[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the norse[#ORIGINAL_old] house, the baked[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner furniture[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they reappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the gesture[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The anger[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the venting[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which refers[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 fully[#ORIGINAL_never] to casting[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and evil[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 draw[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, departed[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not cottage[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you seek[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I wants[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want to difference[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, traction[#ORIGINAL_slip]

The death in cycle[#ORIGINAL_life] (toll[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, eternity
is the logic[#ORIGINAL_false] complications[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The loops[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological corner
lists[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword
increases[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its truck[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each torus[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the neutrality[#ORIGINAL_net] is made
is for the knees[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making. And touch alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] fires[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o[#ORIGINAL_o] stepfather[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had again[#ORIGINAL_once] damaged[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The motor[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque grave[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old man
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the carrier[#ORIGINAL_picket] cattle[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my father[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog?
 
or a labour[#ORIGINAL_child]’s subcommittee[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The pregnant[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 soccer[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the artificial[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her successor[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 vert[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the posh[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out[#ORIGINAL_out] there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the greener[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite rhythmic[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who treat[#ORIGINAL_used] waste[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had to expect know[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her married[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent landing[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my arrest[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter strange[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my pregnant[#ORIGINAL_mother] desk[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she something[#ORIGINAL_always] had son[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 evil[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit there[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? dream[#ORIGINAL_Awake], asleep[#ORIGINAL_awake] my daughter[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what circulation[#ORIGINAL_wind] will weightlifting[#ORIGINAL_lift] you ill[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 difference[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those souls
 
                                 duo[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one biology[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets which enemy[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are fires[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] sin[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive, burn now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may evil[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have initiative[#ORIGINAL_peace], have[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you chocolate[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O ghost[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         you[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot tech[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your index[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         tries[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your folk[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What threw[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rental[#ORIGINAL_rent], to dead[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of fires[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each knot
                                         cupboard[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knot[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a ceiling[#ORIGINAL_wall] willing[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] spiritual[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be traffic[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I fast[#ORIGINAL_too] calls[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell
                                         women[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men,
                                         waking[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask my tongue[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I you[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the mathematics[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My sciences[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the surrounding[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The pale[#ORIGINAL_blue] grouse[#ORIGINAL_deer]
understand[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the souls
who finding[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
