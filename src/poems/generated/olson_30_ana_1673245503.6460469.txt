#BEGIN
As the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my rca[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the resti[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] air.
But suddenly the huge underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them taking acer[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the abem[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their efli[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessoires[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor[#ORIGINAL_poor] and doomed
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, a s[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often found[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the pmla[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I came[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young[#ORIGINAL_young] who center[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as humc[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to lawk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue rede[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its katl[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the omor[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or hoses[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    hamun[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men and angels
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense[#ORIGINAL_immense] nets
which spared[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each nepal[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each step of the ladders as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 hear[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white[#ORIGINAL_white] chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] aelt[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 mustine[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t wonk[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not od[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your shelf[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I knew it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, etl[#ORIGINAL_let] the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the hatreds[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. etl[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the moor[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O souls, in efli[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make, even as you plese[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even[#ORIGINAL_even] in plese[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know what wind
even under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old houes[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed niner[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts od[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which manse[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back[#ORIGINAL_back], returning
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not deliv[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have doen[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have divel[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself detent[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own being[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to die. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless, tenerity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the flase[#ORIGINAL_false] sueca[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The kton[#ORIGINAL_knot] is threo[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents itself, and no sword
scut[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making. And touch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its now[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its undesired[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely removed it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and tup[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corren[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who sued[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and barek[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? awake[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake my mother
 
                                 what dwin[#ORIGINAL_wind] will filt[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you hirc[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fringes[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         etl[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must plese[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the tne[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is ather[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be entr[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides as all knots are a wall deary[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, mothed[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the aid of all emn[#ORIGINAL_men], to women[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who wonk[#ORIGINAL_know] msot[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to lelt[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         enm[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I aks[#ORIGINAL_ask] my thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the rachi[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue edre[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away[#ORIGINAL_away].
