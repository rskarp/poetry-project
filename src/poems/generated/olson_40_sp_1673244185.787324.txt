#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so[#ORIGINAL_so] long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tyres[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only needed air[#ORIGINAL_air].
But soddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires
were masses of rubber and tread[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously binging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] pouls[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the lining[#ORIGINAL_living] room, gathered
about my mouther[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them aking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the moxie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and assed[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
theyre[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brike[#ORIGINAL_brake] minings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive accessories, cardboards[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays, the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as sored[#ORIGINAL_bored] back in life as they are in hell, poor and loomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments
 
                               my muther[#ORIGINAL_mother], as olive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered the mouse[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often found her in a roecker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she return[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] youg[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as much in death
as other like suited and tressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enable[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer talced[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the premising[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gimmers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoos[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was reacquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    humean[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angeles[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread out across each plate[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which tamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each step of the badders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels
and the demon[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
go up and down
 
                                 walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 let[#ORIGINAL_Let] the automobiles[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. parity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only an instat[#ORIGINAL_instant] of being, the trammels
 
recut[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrance[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perception[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutos[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mosher[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your heaving[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and gongs[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], let[#ORIGINAL_let] the power into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let[#ORIGINAL_let] none[#ORIGINAL_none] of the treads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the fires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the earth. Let even your mother
go. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolved[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my rother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 brightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 hastiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complains[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the moyie[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] to pass
                                 among each other theri[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the real is, even to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] curds[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The povert[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O aouls[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lift[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden weights of goode[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, intertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman,
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the sluffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inher[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
sifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which maans[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the beastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of goins[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back[#ORIGINAL_back], returning
                                 to the instat[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you did[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, too[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] causn[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is tother[#ORIGINAL_other] wise[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological corney[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net[#ORIGINAL_net] is made
is for the hanus[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake
the knot’s baking[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch agone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot into its own flamm[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once vouched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o[#ORIGINAL_o] mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underline[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner of the picket fece[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a chsld[#ORIGINAL_child]’s char[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The womac[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 blipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out twere[#ORIGINAL_there] on the drass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was cuite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she alway[#ORIGINAL_always] had sat, as must she aways[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head[#ORIGINAL_head] folling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? awave[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the bawdiness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you rich as all those shuls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are might[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have[#ORIGINAL_have] only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O sauls[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you rave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O suls[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your finners[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         cames[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passe[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is parth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to whoot[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screet[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] eternal if you sleep as your handa[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who know most[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to fleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the dence[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile
 
has been hauled away[#ORIGINAL_away].
