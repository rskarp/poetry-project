#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I craw[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my koor[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sooting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But soddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbidder[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubi[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the living reim[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
plowing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the yong[#ORIGINAL_young] mohn[#ORIGINAL_man] on my route[#ORIGINAL_right] and assed[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he bigged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
pore[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays, the dead rooming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, par[#ORIGINAL_poor] and doomed
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, ose[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as iver[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered the heise[#ORIGINAL_house] as I offen[#ORIGINAL_often] fond[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I cum[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she retains[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the hoose[#ORIGINAL_house] once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her ose[#ORIGINAL_as] mache[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like sooted[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people deed[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
eure[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer tacked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next rhem[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of oiled[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped woke[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was sacking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nots[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the damons[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. Purity
 
is onely[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hoyden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the ploce[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall gat[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not knawe[#ORIGINAL_know]
how defiantly[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are bak[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your fouse[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I now[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your hiving[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of lief[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are untangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my cel[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the power into the last runkel[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the ptyas[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be leafed[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the uthe[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mather[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows to mote[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly soak[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie, each otha[#ORIGINAL_other], marly[#ORIGINAL_merely] to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the reihl[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even to the display cords[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in liffe[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wond[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden weights of goads[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 fout[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner rome[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts die[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spady[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must halve[#ORIGINAL_have] the vaunt[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghostliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not loved[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have loved[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you dade[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I wont[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, ter[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 eh[#ORIGINAL_O] my cel[#ORIGINAL_soul], sleep[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death in loffe[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no cered[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each neet[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s macing[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own flaum[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] tetched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I lacked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white dig[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The wimmin[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the wyman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next dorr[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slept[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out their[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastique[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 houghed[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] thongs[#ORIGINAL_things] to skied[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and broke[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her sinn[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just than[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever set[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 moke[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those seals[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         olive[#ORIGINAL_alive], bowne[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         halve[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, hove[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         goe[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one neet[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a werle[#ORIGINAL_wall] rowdy[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot up on[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are onely[#ORIGINAL_only] atonal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you slip[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hindes[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be boozy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, methode[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women mest[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, moines[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stew[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair.
My chair
is in the koerner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sates[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] mooed[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue dour[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been haled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away.
