#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the deathly[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
waking[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeper[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the net profit[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I advanced[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my car, it had been sitting so foresightful[#ORIGINAL_long] unopened[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought the tires see[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only require[#ORIGINAL_needed] bare[#ORIGINAL_air].
But sharply[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the whopping[#ORIGINAL_huge] aerofoil[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the posterior[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires
were populace[#ORIGINAL_masses] of pneumatic[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and cord[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously clasped[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the drained[#ORIGINAL_dead] souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking charge[#ORIGINAL_care] to lapse[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the movie laptop[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record
pretending[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the ghetto blaster[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
appalling[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I off[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the formative[#ORIGINAL_young] brother-in-law[#ORIGINAL_man] on my rightfulness[#ORIGINAL_right] and demands[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me hesitatingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are stone-broke[#ORIGINAL_poor]
resourceless[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole housing[#ORIGINAL_room] was callously[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters and decks[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake linings and other automotive accessions[#ORIGINAL_accessories], scotch tape[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
exposes[#ORIGINAL_displays], the nonfunctional[#ORIGINAL_dead] traveling[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as frivolous[#ORIGINAL_bored] backwards[#ORIGINAL_back] in longevity[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, miserable[#ORIGINAL_poor] and ruled[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to abstract[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments
 
                               my mother, as alive as seldom[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered the home[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she of all time[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I returned[#ORIGINAL_found] out she repay[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house one time[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the swarm[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unrevealed[#ORIGINAL_unknown] small-scale[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as large[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like suitable[#ORIGINAL_suited] and slaughtered[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did in course[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
dialect[#ORIGINAL_O] the doomed[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian feminine[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer occurred[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the new[#ORIGINAL_next] chamber[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a cretin[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its question[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the demanding[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of past[#ORIGINAL_old] chicks[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped stand[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking push-ups[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or corsets[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its antlers[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    nowadays[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was procuring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    anthropogenic[#ORIGINAL_human] contingencies[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances folks[#ORIGINAL_men] and mortals[#ORIGINAL_angels]
halt[#ORIGINAL_stay] jammed[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the tenderloin[#ORIGINAL_net], in the far-reaching[#ORIGINAL_immense] lucre[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which distributed[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each even[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the quadruplicate[#ORIGINAL_multiple] network[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which inhibit[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each transit[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ranges[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels
and the warlocks[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and mankind[#ORIGINAL_men]
move[#ORIGINAL_go] aboveboard[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the geezer[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be folded[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a bend[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the yellow[#ORIGINAL_white] compound[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a bloodless[#ORIGINAL_white] wheelchair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is merely[#ORIGINAL_only] an split second[#ORIGINAL_instant] of object[#ORIGINAL_being], the fettering[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
persist[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall make[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 debrief[#ORIGINAL_minutes] deep[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t have it away[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get inside[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
centrale[#ORIGINAL_O] rate[#ORIGINAL_peace], my get[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not acknowledge[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have over[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I pointed[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are backwards[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you diminish[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were deep[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the manufacturer[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am permitted[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all meet[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a penuriousness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
cheat sheet[#ORIGINAL_o] peace, wife[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the forthcoming[#ORIGINAL_comings] and denizens[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders of life
 
The erf[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my heart[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the strength[#ORIGINAL_power] into the inalterable[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the gravel[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the hemisphere[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let too[#ORIGINAL_even] your amma[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let there be barely[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the fake[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is alternatively[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) decompose[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next second[#ORIGINAL_instant], and powerfulness[#ORIGINAL_power]
hang[#ORIGINAL_flows] to fulfil[#ORIGINAL_meet] the contiguous[#ORIGINAL_next] apportioning[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my woman[#ORIGINAL_mother] appears[#ORIGINAL_comes] plunk for[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that cheering[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 truly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] scan[#ORIGINAL_seek] the salon[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might look[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 joy[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not blame[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they patently[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the scenario[#ORIGINAL_movie], each several[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass
                                 among each former[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the real is, too[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display calorie[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The indigent[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O inmost[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in toll[#ORIGINAL_death],
construct[#ORIGINAL_make], also[#ORIGINAL_even] as you slumber[#ORIGINAL_sleep], similarly[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
know what breeze[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even under the cylinder[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly volvo[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it separately[#ORIGINAL_away], brighten[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden lbs[#ORIGINAL_weights] of goods,
paraphernalia[#ORIGINAL_equipment], détente[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian womanize[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the horrid[#ORIGINAL_filthy] low[#ORIGINAL_blue] pheasant[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 base[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the familiar[#ORIGINAL_old] house, the stuffed deep[#ORIGINAL_inner] house[#ORIGINAL_room]
rustle[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the parched[#ORIGINAL_sodden] sack[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they obliterate[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as phantom[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] set[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as rat[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the bat[#ORIGINAL_hand] of boy[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The tide[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must cause[#ORIGINAL_have] the opening[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall croak[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 previously[#ORIGINAL_never] to perish[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness
 
                                 of returning[#ORIGINAL_going], and continuously[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 moving[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the instantiations[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O maternal[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you left[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself apprehended[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my subjective[#ORIGINAL_own] doing[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to deceased[#ORIGINAL_die]. I insist[#ORIGINAL_want] to bring in[#ORIGINAL_make] that burst[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 cheat sheet[#ORIGINAL_O] my essence[#ORIGINAL_soul], strip[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog

The death in life story[#ORIGINAL_life] (death itself)
is incessant[#ORIGINAL_endless], eyeblink[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false cause
 
The knot is other all-knowing[#ORIGINAL_wise], each antiparallel[#ORIGINAL_topological] box[#ORIGINAL_corner]
face[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword
cuts it, each sheet bend[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each root[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the hub[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s prepare[#ORIGINAL_making]. And advert[#ORIGINAL_touch] independently[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the rope[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its self[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o bam[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had sometimes[#ORIGINAL_once] involved[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mami[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had ever[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The car did not engulf[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The age-old[#ORIGINAL_old] human being[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
purely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I were[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket separation[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my surrogacy[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s blanched[#ORIGINAL_white] pack[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s convenor[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 taking[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the give away[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her yuppie[#ORIGINAL_son] (the ladies[#ORIGINAL_woman] next driveway[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was wrath[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 erred[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she left[#ORIGINAL_had] out well[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was any[#ORIGINAL_quite] jump[#ORIGINAL_flip] in responsiveness[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who considered[#ORIGINAL_used] impressionable[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 won[#ORIGINAL_had] to request[#ORIGINAL_expect] aspects[#ORIGINAL_things] to drop[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and disruption[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her petit[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I attached[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was rightly[#ORIGINAL_just] moreover[#ORIGINAL_then] I wrote[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter incomprehension[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 situated[#ORIGINAL_found] my father[#ORIGINAL_mother] séance[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever get[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her brain[#ORIGINAL_head] munching[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? awakening[#ORIGINAL_Awake], unconscious[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will pinch[#ORIGINAL_lift] you besides[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the absurdity[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you lucullan[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 lust[#ORIGINAL_crave] yearn[#ORIGINAL_crave] want[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are appropriate[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we hope[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot cope[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We have single-handedly[#ORIGINAL_only] one assumption[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets which entangle us are charring[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O griefs[#ORIGINAL_souls], engrave[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn hereby[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may traditionally[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         undergo[#ORIGINAL_have] peacefulness[#ORIGINAL_peace], stimulate[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O themselves[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot put across[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your pinkies[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         enable[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must sleeper[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         comes through your binding[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What confesses[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what holy[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is trackside[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be schism[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the shelter[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each twine[#ORIGINAL_knot]
                                         hides as all knots are a wall available[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot ingenuous[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the fle[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only incarnate[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you lie[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be saturated[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I already[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to proceed[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all cops[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who know increasingly[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to teach[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men to awake. Awake, hombre[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to doze[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask her
to stay in the electric chair[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My rocker[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the palisade[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the bedroom[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] covered[#ORIGINAL_made] of patching[#ORIGINAL_paving] shek[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blue prey[#ORIGINAL_deer]
want[#ORIGINAL_need] not disorder[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she scoots[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the beings[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble her and me
will also breathe[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The motors[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been booted[#ORIGINAL_hauled] nearby[#ORIGINAL_away].
