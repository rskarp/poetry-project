#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tiros[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbids[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the mobie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
poor. And the whole room was suddenly potters[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaring[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often fond[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much[#ORIGINAL_much] in dath[#ORIGINAL_death]
as oher[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed peuple[#ORIGINAL_people] did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enable[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the oppressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was geeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquitting[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each lane[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step[#ORIGINAL_step] of the madders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels
and the demons
and men
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white sence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white chair. durity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have done[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were salive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a chewiness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the cumings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are untangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, let[#ORIGINAL_let] the fower[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the warth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your yother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolve[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant, and mower[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, in life[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifes[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away, clears the shodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the poods[#ORIGINAL_foods] the Indian woman,
the filthy blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed nner[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts the sodden nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the hastiness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coding[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death in life (derth[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false caise[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is other wise[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological cornier[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no dword[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alore[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] pouched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presentees[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner of the bicket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fenice[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my myther[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 plying[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 clipped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the gras[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in repl[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit theyre[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crare[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crake[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O suls[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is erth[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you bleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to omen[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to aware[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the dence[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the fireplace made[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving stones. The blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouple[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
