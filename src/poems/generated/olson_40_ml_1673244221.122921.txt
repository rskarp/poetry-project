#BEGIN
As the unprofitable[#ORIGINAL_dead] sacrifice[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the unprofitable[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
wakeful[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping bags[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting crucially[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were peasantry[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber and thread obscurely[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the vivid[#ORIGINAL_living] place[#ORIGINAL_room], accumulated[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them reaching[#ORIGINAL_taking] maintenance[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass
beneath the array[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the moving picture[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector, some taping[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing on the squeezebox[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their aliveness[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I been[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the infantile[#ORIGINAL_young] brah[#ORIGINAL_man] on my ripe[#ORIGINAL_right] and common[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
inside[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
slummy[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive plugins[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in society[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and ordered[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere supplies[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, ac[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as incessantly[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep
when I entered the residential[#ORIGINAL_house] as I easily[#ORIGINAL_often] found her in a psychedelic rock[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I raised[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns to the family[#ORIGINAL_house] thereafter[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who mall[#ORIGINAL_center] on her non[#ORIGINAL_as] much in death
as other like suited and dressed people did in life
 
idiomatic[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead!
 
                    and the Indian womanliness[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to exit[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the incoming[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a geezer[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of antique[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped pass[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking lows[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    presently[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human opportunities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men and devils[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay arrest[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multipronged[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the investors[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the maniac[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
go down[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 climb[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a town[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the white fence
                                 when it is a white bureau[#ORIGINAL_chair]. innocence[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only an split second[#ORIGINAL_instant] of being, the trams[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, improvement[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is blocked[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the topographic point[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 hours[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the lorry[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
dnv[#ORIGINAL_O] concord[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother, I do not mean[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have posed[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you dropped[#ORIGINAL_fall] fast asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the flop[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are immediate[#ORIGINAL_present] there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as fossil[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your gaining[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all obtain[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The gears[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entwined[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let nothing[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and cao[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires
be left upon the earth. release[#ORIGINAL_Let] that[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
blend[#ORIGINAL_go]. stop[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be absolutely[#ORIGINAL_only] hkd[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and strong[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to run across[#ORIGINAL_meet] the imminent[#ORIGINAL_next] advent[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any urge[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother among[#ORIGINAL_comes] in reply[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 appropriately[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room
                                 where they might pretend[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness? They did not invoke[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of sciences[#ORIGINAL_life], they really[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to hap[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each another[#ORIGINAL_other] though[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the real is, even to the display permit[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O lives[#ORIGINAL_souls], in learning[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,
seduce[#ORIGINAL_make], too[#ORIGINAL_even] as you suspended[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
know what wind
even under the pistons[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, representation[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the printed[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman,
the filthy blueish[#ORIGINAL_blue] elk[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 pied[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old hut[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed 6th[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as paranormal[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do,
                                 as spider layers[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the face[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man
 
                                 The vent! You must deliver[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of point[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the second[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not reside[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 idiomatic[#ORIGINAL_O] momma[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have posed[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my part[#ORIGINAL_own] subject[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to dead[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to take a shit[#ORIGINAL_make] that new york minute[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my same[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The punishment[#ORIGINAL_death] in anima[#ORIGINAL_life] (end[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is open-ended[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false suit[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The nematode[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other worthwhile[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological corner
presents itself, and no blood[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each sailor[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is derived[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the mobile[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can turn the burl[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had afterwards[#ORIGINAL_once] covered[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o grandma[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its rear[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented to me
a inhuman[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] carcass[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The rusty[#ORIGINAL_old] laddie[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the boycott[#ORIGINAL_picket] separation[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a pedophile[#ORIGINAL_child]’s place[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The madwoman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the sens[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her tiny[#ORIGINAL_son] (the females[#ORIGINAL_woman] next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 plunged[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the cubby[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite rotating[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 featured[#ORIGINAL_had] to desire[#ORIGINAL_expect] things to skid
 
                                 and severance[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t gold[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her boy[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been injury[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 out[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was fair-and-square[#ORIGINAL_just] when[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my house
                                 and to my deep[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 set up[#ORIGINAL_found] my mother sitting indeed[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she steadfastly[#ORIGINAL_always] had set[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she permanently[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 evermore[#ORIGINAL_forever] solidify[#ORIGINAL_sit] currently[#ORIGINAL_there] her straits[#ORIGINAL_head] cavorting[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? woke[#ORIGINAL_Awake], alive[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will rise[#ORIGINAL_lift] you there[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 definitely[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you ample[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave bask[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are honourable[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot take[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We induce[#ORIGINAL_have] only one course:
 
the fillets[#ORIGINAL_nets] which insnarl[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are aflame[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         one-horse town[#ORIGINAL_O] innocents[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive, scorched[#ORIGINAL_burn] this[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may historically[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         possess[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, deserve[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         blend in[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let not one rope[#ORIGINAL_knot] reach[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your phalanges[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         need[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they educate[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must suspended[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what sin[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be pension[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         secretes[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the earnings[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only ceaseless[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep as your sins[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I equally[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to become[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all duo[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who wit[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to exwife[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell
                                         men to awakening[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my fuss[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I instruct[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the bench[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the doorstep[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the dealer[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She remains[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the countertop[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] covered[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving lapidate[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blue blacktail[#ORIGINAL_deer]
should[#ORIGINAL_need] not mayhem[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also breathe[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The vehicle[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been pulled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away.
