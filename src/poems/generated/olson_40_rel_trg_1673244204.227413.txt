#BEGIN
As the grave[#ORIGINAL_dead] birds[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
aware[#ORIGINAL_awake], my overnight[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] shell[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my chase[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so[#ORIGINAL_so] jump[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the rims[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only needed air.
But sudden[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the hit[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear caution[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were jupiter[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber and beads[#ORIGINAL_thread] bce[#ORIGINAL_variously] fur[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together
 
as were the dead souls in the living bedroom[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them oath[#ORIGINAL_taking] care to pass
beneath the splitter[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector, some record
playing on the discs[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the man[#ORIGINAL_young] man on my angle[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t asks[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
poor. And the whole[#ORIGINAL_whole] lounge[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake linings and other automobile[#ORIGINAL_automotive] sells[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the walking[#ORIGINAL_dead] sprint[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as hole[#ORIGINAL_bored] back[#ORIGINAL_back] in imprisonment[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, relief[#ORIGINAL_poor] and repeat[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipments
 
                               my maria[#ORIGINAL_mother], as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often moist[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the glow[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I moist[#ORIGINAL_found] out she tells[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house again[#ORIGINAL_once] a billboard[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the assailant[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who scope[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much in death
as other like suited and clown[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did in sentence[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
O the grateful[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    survive[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the yellow[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the white[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of norse[#ORIGINAL_old] prostitution[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the temperature[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking trousers[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquired[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    animal[#ORIGINAL_human] burst[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the municipality[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which aged[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the fallen[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons
and men
go up and down
 
                                 talk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the dealership[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be leather[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white fencing[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white mathematics[#ORIGINAL_chair]. tone[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
treated[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 bench[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 longest[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the motorcycle[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall you[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] conflict[#ORIGINAL_peace], my teacher[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I agree[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you love[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your coloured[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I wanted[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all cure[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o[#ORIGINAL_o] democracy[#ORIGINAL_peace], father[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are scandal[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, slip[#ORIGINAL_let] nor[#ORIGINAL_none] of the embroidery[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the tires
be left upon the orbit[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mary[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is pain[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the fastest[#ORIGINAL_next] facebook[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power
flows to meet the next mineral[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother realize[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the walls[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might you[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness? They did not perceived[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the telugu[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other[#ORIGINAL_other] there[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the zaragoza[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even to the display deck[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O unitarian[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make, even as you therapy[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
know what chill[#ORIGINAL_wind]
though[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase of the woman[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobile
lifts it net[#ORIGINAL_away], mind[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden weights[#ORIGINAL_weights] of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy purple[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer, the 4 by 3 mountain[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the styles[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the norse[#ORIGINAL_old] residence[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed inner furniture[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts the metal[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they smoke[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of mega[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The limbs[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which refers[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 fully[#ORIGINAL_never] to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of nba[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 minute[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, spell[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not buried[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you agree[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want to suicide[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to make that instant, fast[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 tense[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my survivor[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog

The throne[#ORIGINAL_death] in imprisonment[#ORIGINAL_life] (baronet[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] intersection[#ORIGINAL_corner]
lists[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the income[#ORIGINAL_net] is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s landfall[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can worse[#ORIGINAL_turn] the pile[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o catherine[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had again[#ORIGINAL_once] angel[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had again[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a monster[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] grave[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The norse[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I seemed[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket entrance[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother’s white wolf[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a adolescent[#ORIGINAL_child]’s ethics[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the dress[#ORIGINAL_woman] next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out[#ORIGINAL_out] there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass
 
                                 And I was possibly[#ORIGINAL_quite] upside[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect done[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t thing[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her sultan[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I telegram[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I platinum[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my shock[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found my tongue[#ORIGINAL_mother] listening[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had peer[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever waiting[#ORIGINAL_sit] there[#ORIGINAL_there] her assistant[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? waking[#ORIGINAL_Awake], waking[#ORIGINAL_awake] my aunt[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will curse[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we leave[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot salary[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one golf[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets which enemy[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have security[#ORIGINAL_peace], have[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         die[#ORIGINAL_let] not one overhand[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         tell[#ORIGINAL_let] not any they told[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must wake[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what undertaker[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to dead[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a doorway[#ORIGINAL_wall] accept[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot round[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be freight[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I ill[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to fruition[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all men, to wear[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who understand[#ORIGINAL_know] most, to lover[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tells[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the university[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving diameter[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blue deer
understand[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who finding[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile
 
has been hauling[#ORIGINAL_hauled] net[#ORIGINAL_away].
