#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping weans[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my kir[#ORIGINAL_car], it had been sitting so long unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
 
as were the dead sirles[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living rum[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the bem[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the yong[#ORIGINAL_young] man on my writ[#ORIGINAL_right] and aced[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole reim[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake leanings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard
displays, the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as olive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep
when I unted[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often find[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I cum[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns to the house once a walke[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the unknown yong[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her ose[#ORIGINAL_as] much in death
as otha[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the nixed[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jacchus[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its tike[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped wok[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense netts[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up and down
 
                                 wick[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 loot[#ORIGINAL_Let] the otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tacked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white chair. Purity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is in lieu[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hoedown[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not new[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not dew[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you heave[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the cumings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly sac[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the mahvi[#ORIGINAL_movie], each otha[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death,
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inno[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden nots[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as guests[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do,
                                 as spider webbs[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall de[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghostliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 combing[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not laved[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have dean[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], to[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect
 
                                 oi[#ORIGINAL_O] my searle[#ORIGINAL_soul], slap[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The dith[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false[#ORIGINAL_false] kaus[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is otha[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no cered[#ORIGINAL_sword]
cuts[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can tune[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old man
 
marly[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the packett[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the werman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next door)
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slurped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flop[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was jest[#ORIGINAL_just] then I went into my house
                                 and to my auto[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 fined[#ORIGINAL_found] my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother] sighting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sot[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will leafed[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too
                                 forever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must halve[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afeard[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O cells[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         hove[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, heave[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all manne[#ORIGINAL_men], to wiman[#ORIGINAL_women] most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         mann[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sates[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
