#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the netz[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] ere[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging together
 
as were the dead soles[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living[#ORIGINAL_living] room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beem[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector, some reckard[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man on my right and ast[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
their[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poore[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole roome[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of break[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other[#ORIGINAL_other] automotive accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored[#ORIGINAL_bored] bak[#ORIGINAL_back] in life[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments
 
                               my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], as alive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered[#ORIGINAL_entered] the hauss[#ORIGINAL_house] as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as much in death[#ORIGINAL_death]
as other like suited and dressed people[#ORIGINAL_people] did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the next reaume[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of olde[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the rheaume[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] sox[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances men and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] nets
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each stepp[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the demons[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and menn[#ORIGINAL_men]
goe[#ORIGINAL_go] up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tucked into a corner of the whyte[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a wight[#ORIGINAL_white] chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the kahre[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
au[#ORIGINAL_O] piece[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother, I do not know
how differently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not dew[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are bak[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I cum[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I new[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you halve[#ORIGINAL_have] the compagnie[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all fined[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
ow[#ORIGINAL_o] piece[#ORIGINAL_peace], mother, for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my sowle[#ORIGINAL_soul], let[#ORIGINAL_let] the power[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last wrinkle[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek[#ORIGINAL_seek] the reaume[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously wanted
                                 the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty[#ORIGINAL_poverty]
                             of hell
 
O soles[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death[#ORIGINAL_death],
make, even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears the sodden weights of goods[#ORIGINAL_goods],
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foote[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner room
lifts the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] netz[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] dew[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider webbs[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand of manne[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never[#ORIGINAL_never] to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming bak[#ORIGINAL_back], returning[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 ow[#ORIGINAL_O] mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want to make that instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], to[#ORIGINAL_too],
                                 perfect
 
                                 eaux[#ORIGINAL_O] my seoul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (death[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false coz[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The nott[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other wise, each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knott[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the nett[#ORIGINAL_net] is made
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the knot into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o mother, if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The car did not burne[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s wight[#ORIGINAL_white] dog[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had to expect things to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her sun[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I wente[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] their[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always had sat[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit their[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? Awake[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift you to[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right. We must halve[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We halve[#ORIGINAL_have] only one corse[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames
 
                                         O sowles[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive, burn now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must sleep as the nett[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your authentic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flaim[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot[#ORIGINAL_shot] open[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the netz[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hans[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the eyde[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men, to women[#ORIGINAL_women] most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most, to woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell
                                         menn[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the chair[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sitts[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue deer
need[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sitts[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the soles[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
