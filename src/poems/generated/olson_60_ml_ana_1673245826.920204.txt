#BEGIN
As the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping nose[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tires[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] air.
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbody was above me, and the rear[#ORIGINAL_rear] tires[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the living[#ORIGINAL_living] room, gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mother, some of them taking[#ORIGINAL_taking] care to pass
beneath the beam[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie[#ORIGINAL_movie] projector[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their file[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I deturn[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole[#ORIGINAL_whole] room was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] posters[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations
of break[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bored[#ORIGINAL_bored] back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to meer[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments
 
                               my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] she was, asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as much[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people[#ORIGINAL_people] did in life
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] the dead[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue dere[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old[#ORIGINAL_old] women[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
and the demons[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jackass[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the white[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a white[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. Purity
 
is only[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being[#ORIGINAL_being], the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes] late[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes[#ORIGINAL_minutes]
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the rca[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not wonk[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not do[#ORIGINAL_do].
 
                                 That you are back each week[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as[#ORIGINAL_as] solid, and your flesh[#ORIGINAL_flesh]
                                 is as I knew[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o[#ORIGINAL_o] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders of file[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the lsat[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the earth. Let even your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. Let[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only[#ORIGINAL_only] paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power
flows[#ORIGINAL_flows] to meet the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seke[#ORIGINAL_seek] the room
                                 where they might except[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the rale[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even to the display cards[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death[#ORIGINAL_death],
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even[#ORIGINAL_even] in sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know what wind
even under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], sarcle[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden weights of goods,
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods[#ORIGINAL_foods] the Indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old house, the stuffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] inner[#ORIGINAL_inner] room[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden nets[#ORIGINAL_nets]
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] do[#ORIGINAL_do],
                                 as spider webs[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand[#ORIGINAL_hand] of man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never[#ORIGINAL_never] to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of going[#ORIGINAL_going], and for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                 coming back, returning[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death[#ORIGINAL_death] in file[#ORIGINAL_life] (death[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false cause
 
The knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net[#ORIGINAL_net] is made[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s making[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] flame[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          o[#ORIGINAL_o] mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched you)
 
The car did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old man[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner of the picket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child[#ORIGINAL_child]’s chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her nso[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out[#ORIGINAL_out] there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who used plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect things to skid
 
                                 and brake[#ORIGINAL_break], that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then[#ORIGINAL_then] I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter[#ORIGINAL_utter] astonishment
                                 found[#ORIGINAL_found] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always had ast[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] there[#ORIGINAL_there] her head[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, awake my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift[#ORIGINAL_lift] you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want[#ORIGINAL_want]. We cannot afford
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the nets which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], have[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell[#ORIGINAL_tell] you
                                         you must sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of flame[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each knot
                                         hides as all knots[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall ready
                                         to be shot[#ORIGINAL_shot] open by you
 
                                                                               the nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to come
                                         to the ida[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all men[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who wonk[#ORIGINAL_know] most[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell[#ORIGINAL_tell]
                                         men[#ORIGINAL_men] to awake. Awake, men[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] stones. The blue[#ORIGINAL_blue] dere[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled[#ORIGINAL_hauled] away.
