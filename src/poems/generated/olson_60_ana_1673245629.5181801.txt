#BEGIN
As the dead pyre[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] nose[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the estn[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused.
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the tires looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed[#ORIGINAL_needed] ari[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thread variously[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging[#ORIGINAL_clinging] together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead] lusso[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living room, gathered
about my thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking care to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the bame[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector[#ORIGINAL_projector], some record[#ORIGINAL_record]
playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I deturn[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young[#ORIGINAL_young] man on my girth[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked[#ORIGINAL_asked], “How is it,
there?” And he begged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t ask, we are poor
poor[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the whole room was suddenly esports[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake lignins[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories, cardboard
displays[#ORIGINAL_displays], the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as robed[#ORIGINAL_bored] back[#ORIGINAL_back] in leif[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a corker[#ORIGINAL_rocker]
under the malp[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I found[#ORIGINAL_found] out she returns to the house once[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the throng[#ORIGINAL_throng] of the unknown[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her as[#ORIGINAL_as] humc[#ORIGINAL_much] in theda[#ORIGINAL_death]
as threo[#ORIGINAL_other] like setuid[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did[#ORIGINAL_did] in life
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] and I
                    enabled[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the lube[#ORIGINAL_blue] dere[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next orom[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro kalt[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like walking[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its kalt[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] grabbe[#ORIGINAL_gabber] of grammes[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of old women[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the room
                    because it was seeking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now that it was acquiring[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human possibilities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances mne[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the tne[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense[#ORIGINAL_immense] nset[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple[#ORIGINAL_multiple] ntes[#ORIGINAL_nets]

In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection[#ORIGINAL_perfection]

                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]

                                 10 minutes aelt[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t wonk[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each kwee[#ORIGINAL_week]

                                 with your efac[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right[#ORIGINAL_right]

                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am udes[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o[#ORIGINAL_o] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings[#ORIGINAL_goings]
of the ladders[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The nets[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my uslo[#ORIGINAL_soul], let[#ORIGINAL_let] the power[#ORIGINAL_power] into the slat[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, elt[#ORIGINAL_let] none of the dearths[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires
be left[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the herat[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. elt[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant[#ORIGINAL_instant]
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power
flows to mete[#ORIGINAL_meet] the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any nedrow[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seke[#ORIGINAL_seek] the omor[#ORIGINAL_room]
                                 where they might expect

                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the vimeo[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to pass

                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty

O souls[#ORIGINAL_souls], in file[#ORIGINAL_life] and in death,

the heaviness of the old hueso[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed[#ORIGINAL_stuffed] renin[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
flits[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts[#ORIGINAL_ghosts] d o[#ORIGINAL_do],

The death in feil[#ORIGINAL_life] (daeth[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the false cause
 
The tonk[#ORIGINAL_knot] is threo[#ORIGINAL_other] wise, each topological corner
presents[#ORIGINAL_presents] itself, and no drows[#ORIGINAL_sword]
scut[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each knot is itself its erfi[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each tonk[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is dame[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the shand[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s kingma[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can turn the kont[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its now[#ORIGINAL_own] fleam[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched me
 
                          o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] crespo[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] nam[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and tup[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence[#ORIGINAL_fence]
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass,
                                 with her nso[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next ordo[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out there[#ORIGINAL_there] on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect[#ORIGINAL_expect] things[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her nos[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I sent[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just[#ORIGINAL_just] then I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had ast[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit there[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what dwin[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too
                                 for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 make you hcir[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those lusso[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave crave crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford[#ORIGINAL_afford]
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are flames[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O lusso[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive[#ORIGINAL_alive], burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, have[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let[#ORIGINAL_let] not one kton[#ORIGINAL_knot] pass
                                         through your fringes[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must peels[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the tne[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your authentic shand[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes[#ORIGINAL_passes]
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is ethra[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be tner[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the censer[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all tonks[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall ready
                                         to be tosh[#ORIGINAL_shot] open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only teneral[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your shand[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy[#ORIGINAL_busy]. Method, thedom[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to come[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the dai[#ORIGINAL_aid] of all nem[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who wonk[#ORIGINAL_know] msot[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell
                                         men to awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I aks[#ORIGINAL_ask] my thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to plese[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I aks[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] in the chair.
My rachi[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sist[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace amed[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] nestos[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The beul[#ORIGINAL_blue] erde[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not boulter[#ORIGINAL_trouble] either of us.
 
And if she sist[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also rest[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The automobile
 
has been hauled away[#ORIGINAL_away].
