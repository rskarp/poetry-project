#BEGIN
As the dead eagles[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my night[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I you[#ORIGINAL_cry] out to you,
disentangle the seine[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
I extinct[#ORIGINAL_thought] the goodyear[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed bases[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread etc[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the living walls[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking centers[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
soccer[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the come[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
abc[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I violent[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the woman[#ORIGINAL_young] man on my hand[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole temperature[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly posters and presentations
of cogs[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roam[#ORIGINAL_roaming] from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and love[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive as ever she was, room[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
when I entered the house as I often[#ORIGINAL_often] found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I fruition[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had
 
I moist[#ORIGINAL_found] out she batman[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the mansion[#ORIGINAL_house] once a week, and with her
the throng of the assailant[#ORIGINAL_unknown] young who center on her as much in death
as other[#ORIGINAL_other] like farming[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people did in life
 
O the alive[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the hindi[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the pink[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue tick[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked,
                    in the fastest[#ORIGINAL_next] room,
                    a Negro morning[#ORIGINAL_talk]
 
                    it was like jogging[#ORIGINAL_walking] a lacy[#ORIGINAL_jackass],
                    and its talk
                    was the remote[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of old suffrage[#ORIGINAL_women]
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was permission[#ORIGINAL_seeking] blazer[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances wear[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay surprise[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each fly[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple petri[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which enemy[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each algorithm[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go[#ORIGINAL_go] up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 think[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the pale[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a marble[#ORIGINAL_white] chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels
 
therapy[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall wants[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the worship[#ORIGINAL_place]
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t answer[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall gets[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my descent[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not really[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were kicking[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are as metal[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I going[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am used to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The franchise[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let below[#ORIGINAL_none] of the threads and pepper[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the wheels[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be join[#ORIGINAL_left] upon the earth. Let even your parents[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. Let there be only casino[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is suffering[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and plants[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the fastest[#ORIGINAL_next] variable[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any marvin[#ORIGINAL_wonder]
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that pilgrims[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not responded[#ORIGINAL_complain]
                                 of expectancy[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously something[#ORIGINAL_wanted]
                                 the adaptation[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to fumble[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the broker[#ORIGINAL_real] is, though[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O christ[#ORIGINAL_souls], in life and in death,
make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the fat[#ORIGINAL_ugly] automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
repair[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment, the foods the tamil[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 horse[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the norse[#ORIGINAL_old] house, the stuffed inner room
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall suicide[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 never to walk[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want to den[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to difference[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false confusion[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The pile[#ORIGINAL_knot] is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
roster[#ORIGINAL_cuts] it, each constrictor[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fire
 
each embedding[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the knot’s landfall[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touch[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not burning[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its paler[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child’s senate[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The abortion[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her muhammad[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was different[#ORIGINAL_quite] flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t you[#ORIGINAL_worry]
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I telegram[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was outside[#ORIGINAL_just] then I went into my house
                                 and to my utter phrase[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 moist[#ORIGINAL_found] my mary[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting there
 
                                 as she something[#ORIGINAL_always] had ranked[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she something[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit there[#ORIGINAL_there] her thorax[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling
                                 into narcolepsy[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? Awake, awake my father[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 evil[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 difference[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have[#ORIGINAL_have] only[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the mesh[#ORIGINAL_nets] which enemy[#ORIGINAL_entangle] us are nhl[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         O souls, notice[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, waste[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may evil[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot drive[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your pointing[#ORIGINAL_fingers]
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must wake[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the gains[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is planet[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be mortgage[#ORIGINAL_rent], to enemy[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of ignition[#ORIGINAL_flame] which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall accept[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, representation[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all wives[#ORIGINAL_men], to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to patient[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, casualties[#ORIGINAL_men],
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the rue[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sits by the hallway[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made of paving stones. The blue cottontail[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happy[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls
who trouble her and me
will also life[#ORIGINAL_rest]. The car[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
 
has been hauled net[#ORIGINAL_away].
