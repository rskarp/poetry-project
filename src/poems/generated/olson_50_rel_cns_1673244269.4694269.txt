#BEGIN
As the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] pro[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] wynns[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sating[#ORIGINAL_sitting] so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused.
I thought the towers[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only needed ore[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge underbidder[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear towers[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses of reiber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and thrid[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously clinging together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the loving[#ORIGINAL_living] room, gathered[#ORIGINAL_gathered]
about my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking car[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I tuned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young mann[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he bugged[#ORIGINAL_begged] me protestingly don’t ask[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
poore[#ORIGINAL_poor]. And the hail[#ORIGINAL_whole] room was suddenly pastose[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake linings and otha[#ORIGINAL_other] automotive[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories[#ORIGINAL_accessories], cardboard[#ORIGINAL_cardboard]
displays, the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead] roaming from one to another
as bared[#ORIGINAL_bored] bak[#ORIGINAL_back] in liff[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I enode[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often ferned[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lampe[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I cam[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she eva[#ORIGINAL_ever] had
 
I found out she returns to the hice[#ORIGINAL_house] once a weik[#ORIGINAL_week], and with her
the throng of the unknown yong[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her ose[#ORIGINAL_as] much in death
as otha[#ORIGINAL_other] like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dyed[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the endian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman and I
                    enabled the blah[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blow[#ORIGINAL_blue] dour[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked,
                    in the next rhime[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers[#ORIGINAL_gammers]
                    of aisled[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped wake[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the raum[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was soaking[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes for its haves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    na[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    humane[#ORIGINAL_human] possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stir[#ORIGINAL_stay] cut[#ORIGINAL_caught] in the net, in the immense newts[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which spread[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladies[#ORIGINAL_ladders] as the angels
and the daimones[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and men
go up and down
 
                                 work[#ORIGINAL_Walk] the jacchus[#ORIGINAL_jackass]
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 lette[#ORIGINAL_Let] the otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
                                 be tact[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corney[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the white faunce[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white char[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is onely[#ORIGINAL_only] an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances], perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall gout[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t nay[#ORIGINAL_know],
 
                                 without the kir[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get their[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
eau[#ORIGINAL_O] peace, my mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not nigh[#ORIGINAL_know]
how differently I could have dern[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I dude[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each weik[#ORIGINAL_week]
                                 that you fall asleep[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the wrought[#ORIGINAL_right]
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I calm[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are ose[#ORIGINAL_as] seeled[#ORIGINAL_solid], and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you heave[#ORIGINAL_have] the campaigner[#ORIGINAL_company]
                                 I am used to your hoving[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all fond[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
uh[#ORIGINAL_o] piece[#ORIGINAL_peace], mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness[#ORIGINAL_mammothness]
of the combings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nitz[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are untangled[#ORIGINAL_entangled] in. Awake,
my soul, lit[#ORIGINAL_let] the pppoa[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rib eye[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the tires
be left upon the auth[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let even your mother
gay[#ORIGINAL_go]. loot[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paredes[#ORIGINAL_paradise]
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next instant, and pyre[#ORIGINAL_power]
flews[#ORIGINAL_flows] to met[#ORIGINAL_meet] the nixed[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence[#ORIGINAL_occurrence]
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes bak[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the mover[#ORIGINAL_movie], each otha[#ORIGINAL_other], merely to peece[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other their[#ORIGINAL_there],
                             where the rael[#ORIGINAL_real] is, even to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in lauf[#ORIGINAL_life] and in dearth[#ORIGINAL_death],
make, even as you slap[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in sleep
know what wende[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even[#ORIGINAL_even] under the crankcase of the ugly otomobil[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] it away[#ORIGINAL_away], clears[#ORIGINAL_clears] the sodden weights of goods,
equipment[#ORIGINAL_equipment], entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy[#ORIGINAL_filthy] blue doerr[#ORIGINAL_deer], the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed ono[#ORIGINAL_inner] ramm[#ORIGINAL_room]
lifts[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they disappear[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do,
                                 as spada[#ORIGINAL_spider] webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vint[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must hove[#ORIGINAL_have] the vent,
                                 or you shall dough[#ORIGINAL_die]. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghostliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of guying[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming bak[#ORIGINAL_back], returning
                                 to the instants[#ORIGINAL_instants] which were not loved[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], this I could not have deign[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you deed[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my eigne[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I wente[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want to make that instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], too,
                                 perfect[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O my soll[#ORIGINAL_soul], sleep[#ORIGINAL_slip]
                                 the cog

The dith[#ORIGINAL_death] in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false kees[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is other whizz[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological koerner[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is mowed[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake
the naught[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s mocking[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch aline[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can tine[#ORIGINAL_turn] the naught[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its eigne[#ORIGINAL_own] flaum[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once tetched[#ORIGINAL_touched] me
 
                          eaux[#ORIGINAL_o] mather[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] tetched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The car did not bowne[#ORIGINAL_burn]. Its underside[#ORIGINAL_underside]
was not presented to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] carps[#ORIGINAL_corpse]. The aisled[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
marly[#ORIGINAL_merely] removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked up at it,
and pert[#ORIGINAL_put] it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s whate[#ORIGINAL_white] dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The weyman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 ploughing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the graisse[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her suen[#ORIGINAL_son] (the wiman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next dohr[#ORIGINAL_door])
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slapped[#ORIGINAL_slipped] across the playpen[#ORIGINAL_playpen] or whatever
                                 she houghed[#ORIGINAL_had] aught[#ORIGINAL_out] there on the grasse[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic
                                 hadd[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect thongs[#ORIGINAL_things] to skied[#ORIGINAL_skid]
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sente[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 durn[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just than[#ORIGINAL_then] I went into my heiss[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting their[#ORIGINAL_there]
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always[#ORIGINAL_always]
                                 forever sit there her head lulling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mathey[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wound[#ORIGINAL_wind] will lift you too
                                 forever[#ORIGINAL_forever] from the tawdriness,
                                 merk[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are rote[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We hove[#ORIGINAL_have] onely[#ORIGINAL_only] one carse[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nats[#ORIGINAL_nets] which entangle us are flumes[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         ee[#ORIGINAL_O] sells[#ORIGINAL_souls], bun[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have pousse[#ORIGINAL_peace], have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         a a[#ORIGINAL_O] souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         loot[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot piss[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must slip[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the net
                                         calms[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your ethenic[#ORIGINAL_authentic] hinze[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hoell[#ORIGINAL_hell] and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the scrine[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all notes[#ORIGINAL_knots] are a wall roddy[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot up on[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the notes[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only atonal[#ORIGINAL_eternal] if you slip[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as your hynes[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, methode[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I ter[#ORIGINAL_too] call on you to calm[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all mean[#ORIGINAL_men], to women mest[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know moste[#ORIGINAL_most], to wiman[#ORIGINAL_woman] to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] my mother
to slop[#ORIGINAL_sleep]. I ask[#ORIGINAL_ask] her
to stay in the chair.
My chare[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stains[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blue doar[#ORIGINAL_deer]
knowed[#ORIGINAL_need] not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sitts[#ORIGINAL_sits] in happiness the souls
who trouble[#ORIGINAL_trouble] her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away[#ORIGINAL_away].
