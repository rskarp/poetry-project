#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my bedding[#ORIGINAL_sleeping] ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been seance[#ORIGINAL_sitting] accordingly[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the great[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging along[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the dead souls in the sustenance[#ORIGINAL_living] board[#ORIGINAL_room], gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to blow over[#ORIGINAL_pass]
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the gramophone[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their duration[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned to the young piece[#ORIGINAL_man] on my rightish[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
inside[#ORIGINAL_there]?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are mediocre[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and addresses[#ORIGINAL_presentations]
of brake acetal[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as tedious[#ORIGINAL_bored] back in coexistence[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to measly[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I broke[#ORIGINAL_entered] the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever won[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as entire[#ORIGINAL_much] in death
as other like favourable[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed people did in life
 
O the unanimated[#ORIGINAL_dead]!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue pheasant[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked,
                    in the next ward[#ORIGINAL_room],
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like stepping[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was dealing[#ORIGINAL_seeking] socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was collecting[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human potentialities[#ORIGINAL_possibilities]
 
In the five hindrances boys[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
which diffuse[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each planar[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 wait[#ORIGINAL_Let] the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white defensive[#ORIGINAL_fence]
                                 when it is a white chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels
 
arise[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall stimulate[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have occupied[#ORIGINAL_done]
what I know[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are conversely[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall slumberous[#ORIGINAL_asleep]
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I doubted[#ORIGINAL_knew] it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the climax[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the ladders of society[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the drive[#ORIGINAL_power] into the endmost[#ORIGINAL_last] wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the terra[#ORIGINAL_earth]. Let yet[#ORIGINAL_even] your mom[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the now[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my female parent[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes back up[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each former[#ORIGINAL_other] there,
                             where the real is, yet[#ORIGINAL_even] to the exhibition[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death,
spend a penny[#ORIGINAL_make], even as you sleep, even in sleep
get it on[#ORIGINAL_know] what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the grassless[#ORIGINAL_sodden] weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the departure[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 oncoming[#ORIGINAL_coming] back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not undergone[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my spirit[#ORIGINAL_soul], slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is particular[#ORIGINAL_other] well-informed[#ORIGINAL_wise], each probabilistic[#ORIGINAL_topological] tip[#ORIGINAL_corner]
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its stove[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each knot of which the net is baked[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch only[#ORIGINAL_alone]
can turn the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had soon[#ORIGINAL_once] touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once thrilled[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The railroad car[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a ugly[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The senescent[#ORIGINAL_old] love[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a block[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the scout[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence
like was it my mother’s white toto[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The homegirl[#ORIGINAL_woman],
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her man[#ORIGINAL_son] (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she faced[#ORIGINAL_had] out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite rotating[#ORIGINAL_flip] in reply
                                 that anyone who used styrofoam[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I transmitted[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went into my sign of the zodiac[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter dismay[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother babysitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever solidify[#ORIGINAL_sit] there her head frolicking[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mama[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you ample[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those unfortunates[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 beseech[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave crave
 
                                 to be well-situated[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are opportune[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have still[#ORIGINAL_only] one course:
 
the fle[#ORIGINAL_nets] which entangle us are cockloft[#ORIGINAL_flames]
 
                                         coxa[#ORIGINAL_O] people[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         undergo[#ORIGINAL_have] peace, received[#ORIGINAL_have]
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O themselves[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot blow over[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must standby[#ORIGINAL_sleep] as the saddle[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         originate[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your idi[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, kind[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too call on you to attain[#ORIGINAL_come]
                                         to the aid of all men, to women furthest[#ORIGINAL_most]
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         watchful[#ORIGINAL_awake]
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the closure[#ORIGINAL_fence].
She sits by the bedroom[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] shot[#ORIGINAL_made] of paving stones. The blue quail[#ORIGINAL_deer]
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in appetite[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
