Infanta Marina

Her slope[#ORIGINAL_terrace] was the pebbles[#ORIGINAL_sand]
And the palms[#ORIGINAL_palms] and the rod[#ORIGINAL_twilight].
 
She made[#ORIGINAL_made] of the motions[#ORIGINAL_motions] of her spin[#ORIGINAL_wrist]
The decorated[#ORIGINAL_grandiose] communication[#ORIGINAL_gestures]
Of her experiment[#ORIGINAL_thought].
 
The rumpling[#ORIGINAL_rumpling] of the pele[#ORIGINAL_plumes]
Of this manual[#ORIGINAL_creature] of the news[#ORIGINAL_evening]
bench[#ORIGINAL_Came] to be sleights[#ORIGINAL_sleights] of wind[#ORIGINAL_sails]
Over the measuring[#ORIGINAL_sea].
 
And whereas[#ORIGINAL_thus] she roamed[#ORIGINAL_roamed]
In the roamings[#ORIGINAL_roamings] of her palm[#ORIGINAL_fan],

eucharist[#ORIGINAL_Partaking] of the lions[#ORIGINAL_sea],
And of the post[#ORIGINAL_evening],
As they flowed[#ORIGINAL_flowed] around
And sounds[#ORIGINAL_uttered] their material[#ORIGINAL_subsiding] audio[#ORIGINAL_sound].
