#BEGIN
As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the assists[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so[#ORIGINAL_so] long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only[#ORIGINAL_only] needed air.
But ill[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread etc[#ORIGINAL_variously] clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young isle[#ORIGINAL_man] on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are needy[#ORIGINAL_poor]
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other gasoline[#ORIGINAL_automotive] accessories, cardboard
exhibit[#ORIGINAL_displays], the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and repeat[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often moist[#ORIGINAL_found] her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she returns to the house again[#ORIGINAL_once] a week, and with her
the throng of the assailant[#ORIGINAL_unknown] woman[#ORIGINAL_young] who mall[#ORIGINAL_center] on her as much in death
as other like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    establish[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the uniform[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer think[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talks[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of norse[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was seeking shorts[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was purchase[#ORIGINAL_acquiring]
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] men and angels
stay caught in the java[#ORIGINAL_net], in the immense nets
which infected[#ORIGINAL_spread] out across each plane of being, the multiple milwaukee[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the mythology[#ORIGINAL_demons]
and enlisted[#ORIGINAL_men]
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be sash[#ORIGINAL_tucked] into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white mathematics[#ORIGINAL_chair]. purification[#ORIGINAL_Purity]
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, sin[#ORIGINAL_perfection]
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes afternoon[#ORIGINAL_late].
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not really[#ORIGINAL_know]
how different[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you love[#ORIGINAL_fall] asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I fruition[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of insurance[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
The jersey[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last oceanus[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let none of the screw[#ORIGINAL_threads] and boots[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the firestone[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth. Let even your anna[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go[#ORIGINAL_go]. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of expectancy[#ORIGINAL_life], they obviously wanted
                                 the cinema[#ORIGINAL_movie], each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, though[#ORIGINAL_even] to the display ace[#ORIGINAL_cards],
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death,
worse[#ORIGINAL_make], though[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep, even in sleep
know what solar[#ORIGINAL_wind]
even under the crankcase of the ugly insurance[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, warner[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the Indian husband[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed pale[#ORIGINAL_inner] room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hands[#ORIGINAL_hand] of mega[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
                                 The vent! You must have[#ORIGINAL_have] the geyser[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which refers[#ORIGINAL_means]
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of nba[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back[#ORIGINAL_back], spell[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants which were not cottage[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done[#ORIGINAL_done],
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself fixture[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my own[#ORIGINAL_own] being
 
                                 I want to walk[#ORIGINAL_die]. I want to difference[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too,
                                 sat[#ORIGINAL_perfect]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] my soul, slip
                                 the cog
 
 
II
 
The death in life (death itself)
is dream[#ORIGINAL_endless], eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other[#ORIGINAL_other] foolish[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the knees[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake
the knot’s debut[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own[#ORIGINAL_own] relay[#ORIGINAL_flame]
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The motor[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a monster[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old isle[#ORIGINAL_man]
 
merely removed it as I seemed[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a boulevard[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a exploitation[#ORIGINAL_child]’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 coaching[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grassland[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her muhammad[#ORIGINAL_son] might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I platinum[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my maternal[#ORIGINAL_mother] sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit there[#ORIGINAL_there] her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, dream[#ORIGINAL_awake] my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness],
                                 make you copper[#ORIGINAL_rich] as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, notice[#ORIGINAL_burn]
                                         kicking[#ORIGINAL_alive], notice[#ORIGINAL_burn] now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O spirit[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is eclipse[#ORIGINAL_earth] to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the user[#ORIGINAL_screen] of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall accept[#ORIGINAL_ready]
                                         to be shot woodland[#ORIGINAL_open] by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, algorithm[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to nbc[#ORIGINAL_awake]. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my marie[#ORIGINAL_mother]
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chairs[#ORIGINAL_chair].
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the attic[#ORIGINAL_fireplace] made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled net[#ORIGINAL_away].
