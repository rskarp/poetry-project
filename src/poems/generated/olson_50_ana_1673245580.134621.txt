As the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead] prey[#ORIGINAL_prey] upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake[#ORIGINAL_awake], my sleeping nose[#ORIGINAL_ones], I cry out to you,
disentangle[#ORIGINAL_disentangle] the ntes[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being!
 
I pushed[#ORIGINAL_pushed] my car, it had been sitting so long[#ORIGINAL_long] unused[#ORIGINAL_unused].
I thought[#ORIGINAL_thought] the estri[#ORIGINAL_tires] looked as though they only needed ira[#ORIGINAL_air].
But suddenly the huge[#ORIGINAL_huge] underbody[#ORIGINAL_underbody] was above me, and the rear resit[#ORIGINAL_tires]
were masses[#ORIGINAL_masses] of rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] and red hat[#ORIGINAL_thread] variously clinging together[#ORIGINAL_together]
 
as were the eadd[#ORIGINAL_dead] souls[#ORIGINAL_souls] in the living room, gathered
about my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], some of them taking cera[#ORIGINAL_care] to pass
beneath the bema[#ORIGINAL_beam] of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola], and all of them
desperate[#ORIGINAL_desperate] with the tawdriness[#ORIGINAL_tawdriness] of their file[#ORIGINAL_life] in hell
 
I turned[#ORIGINAL_turned] to the young man on my right[#ORIGINAL_right] and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly[#ORIGINAL_protestingly] don’t aks[#ORIGINAL_ask], we are poor
poor. And the whole[#ORIGINAL_whole] moor[#ORIGINAL_room] was suddenly[#ORIGINAL_suddenly] esports[#ORIGINAL_posters] and presentations
of kaber[#ORIGINAL_brake] linings[#ORIGINAL_linings] and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back[#ORIGINAL_back] in eifl[#ORIGINAL_life] as they are in hell, poor and doomed[#ORIGINAL_doomed]
to mere[#ORIGINAL_mere] equipments[#ORIGINAL_equipments]
 
                               my mother, as[#ORIGINAL_as] alive[#ORIGINAL_alive] as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often[#ORIGINAL_often] found her in a rocker
under the ampl[#ORIGINAL_lamp], and awaking[#ORIGINAL_awaking], as I mace[#ORIGINAL_came] up to her, as she ever had[#ORIGINAL_had]
 
I found out she returns[#ORIGINAL_returns] to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young[#ORIGINAL_young] who center on her a s[#ORIGINAL_as] much in death
as threo[#ORIGINAL_other] like setuid[#ORIGINAL_suited] and dressed[#ORIGINAL_dressed] people did in efli[#ORIGINAL_life]
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled[#ORIGINAL_enabled] the lube[#ORIGINAL_blue] deer
                    to walk[#ORIGINAL_walk]
 
                    and the blue edre[#ORIGINAL_deer] talked[#ORIGINAL_talked],
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking[#ORIGINAL_walking] a jackass,
                    and its katl[#ORIGINAL_talk]
                    was the pressing[#ORIGINAL_pressing] gabber of gammers
                    of old[#ORIGINAL_old] women
 
                    and we helped walk[#ORIGINAL_walk] it around the ormo[#ORIGINAL_room]
                    because it was seeking socks[#ORIGINAL_socks]
                    or hoses[#ORIGINAL_shoes] for its hooves[#ORIGINAL_hooves]
                    now[#ORIGINAL_now] that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances[#ORIGINAL_hindrances] mne[#ORIGINAL_men] and angels[#ORIGINAL_angels]
stay[#ORIGINAL_stay] caught in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each nepal[#ORIGINAL_plane] of being, the multiple ents[#ORIGINAL_nets]
which hamper[#ORIGINAL_hamper] at each pets[#ORIGINAL_step] of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up[#ORIGINAL_up] and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 hear[#ORIGINAL_Hear] the victrola[#ORIGINAL_victrola]
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white[#ORIGINAL_white] fence
                                 when it is a white chair[#ORIGINAL_chair]. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels[#ORIGINAL_trammels]
 
recur[#ORIGINAL_recur]
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden[#ORIGINAL_hidden]
                                 I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get]
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car[#ORIGINAL_car],
 
                                 how I shall get[#ORIGINAL_get] there
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], I do not know
how differently[#ORIGINAL_differently] I could have done
what I did[#ORIGINAL_did] or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back[#ORIGINAL_back] each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your efca[#ORIGINAL_face] to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come[#ORIGINAL_come] in as you were
                                 when you were alive[#ORIGINAL_alive]
 
                                 that you are a s[#ORIGINAL_as] solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have[#ORIGINAL_have] the company
                                 I am udes[#ORIGINAL_used] to your having[#ORIGINAL_having]
 
                                 but o, that you all find[#ORIGINAL_find] it
                                 such a cheapness[#ORIGINAL_cheapness]!
 
o peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], for the mammothness
of the comings[#ORIGINAL_comings] and goings
of the saddler[#ORIGINAL_ladders] of life
 
The ntse[#ORIGINAL_nets] we are entangled in. Awake,
my olus[#ORIGINAL_soul], let the power[#ORIGINAL_power] into the last wrinkle[#ORIGINAL_wrinkle]
of  being, let none of the dearths[#ORIGINAL_threads] and rubber[#ORIGINAL_rubber] of the siter[#ORIGINAL_tires]
be left upon the earth. Let even[#ORIGINAL_even] your mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
go. etl[#ORIGINAL_Let] there be only paradise
 
The desperateness[#ORIGINAL_desperateness] is, that the instant
which is also[#ORIGINAL_also] paradise (paradise
is happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness]) dissolves[#ORIGINAL_dissolves]
into the next[#ORIGINAL_next] instant[#ORIGINAL_instant], and power[#ORIGINAL_power]
flows to meet the next[#ORIGINAL_next] occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother] comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] back[#ORIGINAL_back]?
                                 Do not that throng[#ORIGINAL_throng]
                                 rightly[#ORIGINAL_rightly] seek the room
                                 where they might expect[#ORIGINAL_expect]
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously[#ORIGINAL_obviously] wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display[#ORIGINAL_display] cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O[#ORIGINAL_O] souls, in lefi[#ORIGINAL_life] and in daeth[#ORIGINAL_death],
make[#ORIGINAL_make], even[#ORIGINAL_even] as you sleep[#ORIGINAL_sleep], even in peles[#ORIGINAL_sleep]
know what wind
even under the crankcase[#ORIGINAL_crankcase] of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment[#ORIGINAL_entertainment], the foods the indian[#ORIGINAL_Indian] woman[#ORIGINAL_woman],
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 otof[#ORIGINAL_foot] ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness[#ORIGINAL_heaviness] of the old hueso[#ORIGINAL_house], the stuffed inner room
flits[#ORIGINAL_lifts] the sodden[#ORIGINAL_sodden] nets
 
                                 and they appraised[#ORIGINAL_disappear] as ghosts do,
                                 as predis[#ORIGINAL_spider] wbes[#ORIGINAL_webs], nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The tenv[#ORIGINAL_vent]! You must have the netv[#ORIGINAL_vent],
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die[#ORIGINAL_die], the ghastliness[#ORIGINAL_ghastliness]
 
                                 of oggin[#ORIGINAL_going], and forever
                                 coming back[#ORIGINAL_back], returning[#ORIGINAL_returning]
                                 to the instants which were not deliv[#ORIGINAL_lived]
 
                                 O[#ORIGINAL_O] mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have deliv[#ORIGINAL_lived] what you did[#ORIGINAL_did]n’t,
                                 I am myself netted[#ORIGINAL_netted] in my now[#ORIGINAL_own] ebing[#ORIGINAL_being]
 
                                 I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to die. I want[#ORIGINAL_want] to make[#ORIGINAL_make] that instant, too[#ORIGINAL_too],

The death in feil[#ORIGINAL_life] (daeth[#ORIGINAL_death] itself)
is endless, entirety[#ORIGINAL_eternity]
is the flase[#ORIGINAL_false] acuse[#ORIGINAL_cause]
 
The knot is threo[#ORIGINAL_other] wesi[#ORIGINAL_wise], each topological[#ORIGINAL_topological] corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each kont[#ORIGINAL_knot] is itself its fier[#ORIGINAL_fire]
 
each kont[#ORIGINAL_knot] of which the net is amed[#ORIGINAL_made]
is for the shand[#ORIGINAL_hands] to untake[#ORIGINAL_untake]
the kton[#ORIGINAL_knot]’s kingma[#ORIGINAL_making]. And touch[#ORIGINAL_touch] alone
can turn[#ORIGINAL_turn] the kton[#ORIGINAL_knot] into its own flame
 
                          (o mother[#ORIGINAL_mother], if you had once touched me
 
                          o thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother], if I had once[#ORIGINAL_once] touched[#ORIGINAL_touched] you)
 
The rca[#ORIGINAL_car] did not burn. Its underside
was not presented[#ORIGINAL_presented] to me
a grotesque[#ORIGINAL_grotesque] corpse. The old[#ORIGINAL_old] man
 
merely removed[#ORIGINAL_removed] it as I looked[#ORIGINAL_looked] up at it,
and put it in a croner[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the picket[#ORIGINAL_picket] fence
like was it my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]’s white dgo[#ORIGINAL_dog]?
 
or a child’s chira[#ORIGINAL_chair]
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing[#ORIGINAL_playing] on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass],
                                 with her son (the woman[#ORIGINAL_woman] next door)
 
                                 was angry[#ORIGINAL_angry] with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had[#ORIGINAL_had] out there on the grass[#ORIGINAL_grass]
 
                                 And I was quite flip[#ORIGINAL_flip] in lepry[#ORIGINAL_reply]
                                 that anyone who usde[#ORIGINAL_used] plastic[#ORIGINAL_plastic]
                                 had[#ORIGINAL_had] to expect hingst[#ORIGINAL_things] to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt[#ORIGINAL_hurt]
                                 by whatever it was I snet[#ORIGINAL_sent] skidding[#ORIGINAL_skidding]
 
                                 down[#ORIGINAL_down] on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went[#ORIGINAL_went] into my house[#ORIGINAL_house]
                                 and to my utter astonishment[#ORIGINAL_astonishment]
                                 found my mother sitting[#ORIGINAL_sitting] there
 
                                 as she always[#ORIGINAL_always] had ast[#ORIGINAL_sat], as must she always
                                 forever sit[#ORIGINAL_sit] there[#ORIGINAL_there] her heda[#ORIGINAL_head] lolling[#ORIGINAL_lolling]
                                 into peels[#ORIGINAL_sleep]? awake[#ORIGINAL_Awake], awake my mother[#ORIGINAL_mother]
 
                                 what wind will lift you too[#ORIGINAL_too]
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make[#ORIGINAL_make] you rich as all those solus[#ORIGINAL_souls]
 
                                 crave carve[#ORIGINAL_crave] crave[#ORIGINAL_crave]
 
                                 to be hcir[#ORIGINAL_rich]?
 
They are right[#ORIGINAL_right]. We must have[#ORIGINAL_have]
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only[#ORIGINAL_only] one soceur[#ORIGINAL_course]:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O[#ORIGINAL_O] solus[#ORIGINAL_souls], burn
                                         alive, burn[#ORIGINAL_burn] now[#ORIGINAL_now]
 
                                         that you may for ever[#ORIGINAL_forever]
                                         have[#ORIGINAL_have] peace[#ORIGINAL_peace], have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O solus[#ORIGINAL_souls],
                                         go[#ORIGINAL_go] into everything,
                                         elt[#ORIGINAL_let] not one knot pass[#ORIGINAL_pass]

                                         you must sleep as the ent[#ORIGINAL_net]
                                         comes[#ORIGINAL_comes] through your authentic shand[#ORIGINAL_hands]
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be tren[#ORIGINAL_rent], to shoot[#ORIGINAL_shoot] you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         ished[#ORIGINAL_hides] as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nest[#ORIGINAL_nets] of being
                                         are only[#ORIGINAL_only] eternal if you sleep as your shand[#ORIGINAL_hands]
                                         ought to be busy. Method, mothed[#ORIGINAL_method]
 
                                         I too[#ORIGINAL_too] call[#ORIGINAL_call] on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most
                                         who know msot[#ORIGINAL_most], to woman to tell[#ORIGINAL_tell]

I aks[#ORIGINAL_ask] my thermo[#ORIGINAL_mother]

to stay in the chair.
My richa[#ORIGINAL_chair]
is in the corren[#ORIGINAL_corner] of the fence.
She sist[#ORIGINAL_sits] by the fireplace made of paving[#ORIGINAL_paving] setons[#ORIGINAL_stones]. The blue deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness[#ORIGINAL_happiness] the solus[#ORIGINAL_souls]
who trouble her and me
will also[#ORIGINAL_also] rest. The automobile[#ORIGINAL_automobile]
