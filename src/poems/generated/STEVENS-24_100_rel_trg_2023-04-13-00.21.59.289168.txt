Poetry Is a bomb[#ORIGINAL_Destructive] Force

That's what pain[#ORIGINAL_misery] is,
Nothing to have[#ORIGINAL_have] at chest[#ORIGINAL_heart].
It is to have[#ORIGINAL_have] or nothing.

It is a something[#ORIGINAL_thing] to have[#ORIGINAL_have],
A arms[#ORIGINAL_lion], an ox[#ORIGINAL_ox] in his lesions[#ORIGINAL_breast],
To you[#ORIGINAL_feel] it chest[#ORIGINAL_breathing] there[#ORIGINAL_there].

Corazn, fleshy[#ORIGINAL_stout] agility[#ORIGINAL_dog],
Young ox, wow[#ORIGINAL_bow]-dressed[#ORIGINAL_legged] arms[#ORIGINAL_bear],
He tastes[#ORIGINAL_tastes] its marrow[#ORIGINAL_blood], not strait[#ORIGINAL_spit].

He is like a isle[#ORIGINAL_man]
In the tail[#ORIGINAL_body] of a criminal[#ORIGINAL_violent] lion[#ORIGINAL_beast].
Its medial[#ORIGINAL_muscles] are his own[#ORIGINAL_own] . . .

The shield[#ORIGINAL_lion] sleeps[#ORIGINAL_sleeps] in the god[#ORIGINAL_sun].
Its drag[#ORIGINAL_nose] is on its tails[#ORIGINAL_paws].
It can agrees[#ORIGINAL_kill] a woman[#ORIGINAL_man].
