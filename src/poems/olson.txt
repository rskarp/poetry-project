Poems to train AI: Olson

As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
as other like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels
 
recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do.
 
                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell
 
O souls, in life and in death,
make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, slip
                                 the cog

The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit there her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being
                                         are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away.
 
 
 
Off-shore, by islands hidden in the blood   
                                        jewels & miracles, I, Maximus
                                        a metal hot from boiling water, tell you   
                                        what is a lance, who obeys the figures of   
                                        the present dance

He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He
remembered only one thing, the birds, how
when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
the one they had hoped was a male
 
Otherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers & Angkor Vat.
He had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,
I do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
in some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, “The kingfishers!
who cares
for their feathers
now?”
 
His last words had been, “The pool is slime.” Suddenly everyone,
ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
“The pool    the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth    why
did the export stop?”
 
It was then he left

I thought of the E on the stone, and of what Mao said
la lumiere”
                    but the kingfisher
de l’aurore”
                    but the kingfisher flew west
est devant nous!
                    he got the color of his breast
                    from the heat of the setting sun!
 
The features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
where the color is, short and round, the tail
inconspicuous.
 
But not these things were the factors. Not the birds.
The legends are
legends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
will not indicate a favoring wind,
or avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,
still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
It is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
It nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,
six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.
 
                                                   On these rejectamenta
(as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
And, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes
                                                              a dripping, fetid mass
 
Mao concluded:
                   nous devons
                                       nous lever

When the attentions change / the jungle

Or,
enter
that other conqueror we more naturally recognize
he so resembles ourselves
 
But the E
cut so rudely on that oldest stone
sounded otherwise,
was differently heard
 
as, in another time, were treasures used:
 
(and, later, much later, a fine ear thought
a scarlet coat)
 
                       “of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes
                        of gold
 
                       “animals likewise,
                        resembling snails
 
                       “a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots,
                        and worked with tufts of leaves, weight
                        3800 ounces
 
                       “last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills
                        gold, the feet
                        gold, the two birds perched on two reeds
 
                        gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,
                        one yellow, the other
                        white.
 
                                     “And from each reed hung
                                      seven feathered tassels.
 
In this instance, the priests
(in dark cotton robes, and dirty,
their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly
over their shoulders)
rush in among the people, calling on them
to protect their gods
 
And all now is war
where so lately there was peace,
and the sweet brotherhood, the use
of tilled fields.

Not one death but many,
not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is
the law
 
                 Into the same river no man steps twice
                 When fire dies air dies
                 No one remains, nor is, one
 
Around an appearance, one common model, we grow up
many. Else how is it,
if we remain the same,
we take pleasure now
in what we did not take pleasure before? love
contrary objects? admire and / or find fault? use
other words, feel other passions, have
nor figure, appearance, disposition, tissue
the same?
         To be in different states without a change
         is not a possibility
 
We can be precise. The factors are
in the animal and / or the machine the factors are
communication and / or control, both involve
the message. And what is the message? The message is
a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time
 
is the birth of the air, is
the birth of water, is
a state between
the origin and
the end, between
birth and the beginning of
another fetid nest
 
is change, presents
no more than itself
 
And the too strong grasping of it,
when it is pressed together and condensed,
loses it

               what cost in gesture justice brings

                      It works out this way, despite the disadvantage.
                      I offer, in explanation, a quote:
                      si j’ai du goût, ce n’est guères
                      que pour la terre et les pierres.
 
                      Despite the discrepancy (an ocean    courage    age)
                      this is also true: if I have any taste
                      it is only because I have interested myself

                      shall you uncover honey / where maggots are?

In this night I moved on the territory with combinations
(new mixtures) of old and known personages: the leader,
my father, in an old guise, here selling books and manuscripts.
 
My thought was, as I looked in the window of his shop,
there should be materials here for Maximus, when, then,
I saw he was the young musician has been there (been before me)
 
before. It turned out it wasn’t a shop, it was a loft (wharf-
house) in which, as he walked me around, a year ago
came back (I had been there before, with my wife and son,
 
I didn’t remember, he presented me insinuations via
himself and his girl) both of whom I had known for years.
But never in Gloucester. I had moved them in, to my country.
 
His previous appearance had been in my parents’ bedroom where I
found him intimate with my former wife: this boy
was now the Librarian of Gloucester, Massachusetts!
 
 
                         Black space,
                         old fish-house.
                         Motions
                         of ghosts.
                         I,
                         dogging
                         his steps.
                         He
                         (not my father,
                         by name himself
                         with his face
                         twisted
                         at birth)
                         possessed of knowledge
                         pretentious
                         giving me
                         what in the instant
                         I knew better of.
 
                         But the somber
                         place, the flooring
                         crude like a wharf’s
                         and a barn’s
                         space
 
 
I was struck by the fact I was in Gloucester, and that my daughter
was there—that I would see her! She was over the Cut. I
hadn’t even connected her with my being there, that she was
 
here. That she was there (in the Promised Land—the Cut!
But there was this business, of poets, that all my Jews
were in the fish-house too, that the Librarian had made a party
 
I was to read. They were. There were many of them, slumped
around. It was not for me. I was outside. It was the Fort.
The Fort was in East Gloucester—old Gorton’s Wharf, where the Library
 
was. It was a region of coal houses, bins. In one a gang
was beating someone to death, in a corner of the labyrinth
of fences. I could see their arms and shoulders whacking
 
down. But not the victim. I got out of there. But cops
tailed me along the Fort beach toward the Tavern
 
                         The places still
                         half-dark, mud,
                         coal dust.
 
                         There is no light
                         east
                         of the Bridge
 
                         Only on the headland
                         toward the harbor
                         from Cressy’s
 
                         have I seen it (once
                         when my daughter ran
                         out on a spit of sand
 
                         isn’t even there.) Where
                         is Bristow? when does I-A
                         get me home? I am caught
 
                         in Gloucester. (What’s buried
                         behind Lufkin’s
                         Diner? Who is

the light does go one way toward the post office,

coming from the sea, up Middle, it is more white, very white

Or now, when such houses are not built,

pejorocracy thrive. Only the lady

made the coast, and though he lost his feet for it,
and the hands he’d purposely allowed to freeze to the oars,   
I knew him, drank
with my elders, in his own bar, a toast to him
 
Or my other, the top of whose head a bollard clean took away.   
It was four days before they could get him to Chelsea Marine.
This spring I listened to him as good as new, as fresh as it’s always been
to hear him talk of the sea. He was puttering in his garden when I came up,
looking over his Santa Fe rose. And he took off his hat to show me,   
how it is all skin where his skull was,
too much of a hole for even the newest metal
to cover
 
Or the quiet one, who’s died since (died as deck-watchman, on his vessel, in port).
Years ago I heard from others
how he’d pulled two men out of the sea one night
off Eastern Point. They’d not been able to shed their jacks
when the ship went over, and when he caught them
they were going down too. He hauled them into Brace’s Cove,
even though the shore wasn’t there, it was such a storm and the sea so big   
it had turned the Lily Pond
into an arm of itself.
 
Last, he with muscle as big as his voice, the strength of him
in that blizzard
to have pulled the trawl slack from the very bottom and released   
his mate from the cod-hook had him out, and almost off,
into the snow. It wasn’t that there was so much sea. It was the cold,   
and that white, until over the dory went and the two of them,
one still,
were in. The wild thing was, he made the vessel, three miles, and fetched her,
found that vessel in all that weather, with his fellow dead weight   
on him. The sort of eye
which later knew the Peak of Brown’s
as though it were his own garden (as Bowditch brought the Eppie Sawyer   
spot to her wharf a Christmas morning)

also of the matter, the most of it, those
who do no more than drink it in a cup of tea alone of such a night, holding

What still is, in other words. And the remarkable part of it,   
that it still goes on, still is
what counts:
 
          the lad from the Fort
who recently bought the small white house on Lower Middle
(the one diagonally across from the handsome brick with the Bullfinch door)
He stood with me one Sunday
and eyed (with a like eye) a curious ship
we’d both come on, tied to the Gas Company wharf.
She had raked masts, and they were unstepped,
fitted loose in her deck, like a neck in a collar.
He was looking idly, as I was, saying nothing.
When suddenly, he turned to a Gloucesterman, a big one,
berthed alongside this queer one, and said:
“I’ll own her, one day”

While she stares, out of her painted face,
no matter the deathly mu-sick, the demand
will arouse
some of these men and women
 
 
 
I have had to learn the simplest things
last. Which made for difficulties.
Even at sea I was slow, to get the hand out, or to cross   
a wet deck.
               The sea was not, finally, my trade.
But even my trade, at it, I stood estranged
from that which was most familiar. Was delayed,
and not content with the man’s argument
that such postponement   
is now the nature of
obedience,
               that we are all late
               in a slow time,
               that we grow up many
               And the single   
               is not easily
               known
 
It could be, though the sharpness (the achiote)   
I note in others,
makes more sense
than my own distances. The agilities
 
               they show daily
               who do the world’s   
               businesses
               And who do nature’s   
               as I have no sense   
               I have done either
 
I have made dialogues,
have discussed ancient texts,
have thrown what light I could, offered   
what pleasures
doceat allows
               
               But the known?
This, I have had to be given,
a life, love, and from one man   
the world.
               Tokens.
               But sitting here
               I look out as a wind   
               and water man, testing   
               And missing
               some proof
 
I know the quarters
of the weather, where it comes from,   
where it goes. But the stem of me,   
this I took from their welcome,
or their rejection, of me
 
               And my arrogance
               was neither diminished   
               nor increased,
               by the communication

I. Le Bonheur
 
dogwood flakes
what is green
 
the petals
from the apple
blow on the road
 
mourning doves
mark the sway
of the afternoon, bees
dig the plum blossoms
 
the morning
stands up straight, the night
is blue from the full of the April moon
 
iris and lilac, birds
birds, yellow flowers
white flowers, the Diesel
does not let up dragging
the plow
 
               as the whippoorwill,
the night’s tractor, grinds
his song
 
 
              and no other birds but us
are as busy (O saisons, O chateaux!
Délires!
 
                What soul
is without fault?
 
Nobody studies
happiness
 
Every time the cock crows
I salute him
 
I have no longer any excuse
for envy. My life
 
has been given its orders: the seasons
seize
 
the soul and the body, and make mock
of any dispersed effort. The hour of death
 
is the only trespass
 
 
II. The Charge
 
dogwood flakes
the green
 
the petals from the apple-trees
fall for the feet to walk on
 
the birds are so many they are
loud, in the afternoon
 
they distract, as so many bees do
suddenly all over the place
 
With spring one knows today to see
that in the morning each thing
 
is separate but by noon
they have melted into each other
 
and by night only crazy things
like the full moon and the whippoorwill
 
and us, are busy. We are busy
if we can get by that whiskered bird,
 
that nightjar, and get across, the moon
is our conversation, she will say
 
what soul
isn’t in default?
 
can you afford not to make
the magical study
 
which happiness is? do you hear
the cock when he crows? do you know the charge,
 
that you shall have no envy, that your life
has its orders, that the seasons
 
seize you too, that no body and soul are one
if they are not wrought
 
in this retort? that otherwise efforts
are efforts? And that the hour of your flight
 
will be the hour of your death?
 
 
III. Spring
 
The dogwood
lights up the day.
 
The April moon
flakes the night.
 
Birds, suddenly,
are a multitude
 
The flowers are ravined
by bees, the fruit blossoms
 
are thrown to the ground, the wind
the rain forces everything. Noise—
 
even the night is drummed
by whippoorwills, and we get
 
as busy, we plow, we move,
we break out, we love. The secret
 
which got lost neither hides
nor reveals itself, it shows forth
 
tokens. And we rush
to catch up. The body
 
whips the soul. In its great desire
it demands the elixir
 
In the roar of spring,
transmutations. Envy
 
drags herself off. The fault of the body and the soul
—that they are not one—
 
the matutinal cock clangs
and singleness: we salute you
 
season of no bungling
